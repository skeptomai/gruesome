# Phase Separation Bug Analysis - IMPLEMENTATION ARCHIVED

**REVERT DECISION (November 1, 2025)**: This computed property implementation has been archived in favor of a simpler conditional print approach. The work is preserved in the `computed-property-implementation-archive` branch and documented in `docs/COMPUTED_PROPERTY_IMPLEMENTATION_ARCHIVE.md`.

**Status**: Phase 1 & 2 completed successfully, Phase 3 partially implemented. Reverted due to complexity vs. benefit analysis.

**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Bug ID**: Phase Separation in Computed Object Properties
**Severity**: Critical - Memory corruption in compiled bytecode
**Root Cause**: TestAttributeBranch implementation exposed pre-existing architectural flaw

## Executive Summary

The implementation of TestAttributeBranch in commit 41e03ff exposed a fundamental phase separation bug where computed object property expressions are compiled during Step 2c (object generation) instead of being properly deferred to Step 2f (code generation). This causes memory layout conflicts and bytecode corruption.

## Problem Statement

When objects contain computed property expressions (like ternary conditionals in `desc` properties), the compiler incorrectly processes these expressions during object table generation rather than deferring them to the code generation phase. This violates the compiler's phase separation architecture and causes memory corruption.

## Technical Details

### Triggering Condition

The bug is triggered by any object with computed property expressions, specifically:

```grue
object mailbox {
    desc: "The small mailbox is " + (mailbox.open ? "open" : "closed") + "."
    //                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    //                              This ternary expression triggers the bug
}
```

### What Happens (Incorrect Behavior)

1. **Step 2c - Object Generation**:
   - Object `mailbox` is processed
   - Property `desc` contains ternary conditional `(mailbox.open ? "open" : "closed")`
   - Compiler immediately compiles this expression, including TestAttributeBranch for `mailbox.open`
   - TestAttributeBranch instruction written to address 0x01a5

2. **Memory Conflict**:
   - Object space simultaneously writes property data to overlapping address ranges (0x01c9, etc.)
   - Code space writes TestAttributeBranch instruction to 0x01a5
   - Memory corruption: test_attr instruction (0x4A) gets overwritten by object data, becomes je (0x41)

3. **Runtime Failure**:
   - Interpreter executes corrupted instruction
   - Wrong branch behavior: `if obj.open` evaluates incorrectly
   - "open mailbox" shows "It's already open" when mailbox should start closed

### What Should Happen (Correct Behavior)

1. **Step 2c - Object Generation**:
   - Object `mailbox` is processed
   - Property `desc` marked as computed property
   - Create property function `mailbox_desc_computed()`
   - Property table contains function address, NOT immediate expression compilation

2. **Step 2f - Code Generation**:
   - Function `mailbox_desc_computed()` compiled with proper memory layout
   - TestAttributeBranch instruction written to code space without conflicts
   - All computed expressions properly deferred

## Evidence Trail

### Debug Output Analysis

```
[DEBUG] üì¶ Collected object description: '[expression]' -> ID 1019
[DEBUG] STRING_PACKED_RESOLVE: String ID 1019 offset=0x05b2 + base=0x087e = final=0x0e30 ‚Üí packed=0x0718
```

This shows `[expression]` being treated as a static string rather than a computed property function call.

### Memory Corruption Evidence

**Expected instruction at 0x01a5**: `4A 20 00 40 XX` (test_attr with 2-byte branch)
**Actual instruction at 0x01a5**: `41 20 00 80 08` (je instruction - corrupted)

### Git History Analysis

- **Before commit 41e03ff**: TestAttributeBranch was silently skipped (not implemented)
- **Commit 41e03ff**: Implemented TestAttributeBranch properly
- **Result**: Previously masked phase separation bug became visible

## Affected Components

### Primary Impact
- Object property compilation (`src/grue_compiler/codegen_objects.rs`)
- Code generation phase management (`src/grue_compiler/codegen.rs`)
- Memory layout management

### Secondary Impact
- Any object with computed property expressions
- TestAttributeBranch and other attribute-related instructions
- Branch evaluation and conditional logic

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why This Bug Exists

The compiler architecture assumes clean phase separation:
- **Step 2c**: Generate static object tables and property data
- **Step 2f**: Generate executable code and functions

However, computed property expressions violate this separation by requiring code generation during object table creation.

### Why It Wasn't Detected Earlier

1. TestAttributeBranch was not implemented (silently skipped)
2. Computed expressions would fail compilation but not crash
3. No instruction corruption occurred without TestAttributeBranch implementation
4. The underlying phase separation flaw remained hidden

## Solution Requirements

### Architectural Fix Required

**All computed object property expressions must be converted to property function calls that are properly deferred to Step 2f.**

Instead of:
```
Property 2: "[expression]" -> string ID 1019 -> static string
```

Should be:
```
Property 2: computed_property_mailbox_desc() -> function call deferred to Step 2f
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Identify Computed Properties**: During object analysis, detect expressions that require computation
2. **Generate Property Functions**: Create individual functions for each computed property
3. **Defer Compilation**: Mark property functions for Step 2f compilation
4. **Update Property Tables**: Store function addresses instead of expression results

## Test Cases

### Verification Test 1: Memory Layout
Ensure TestAttributeBranch instructions maintain correct opcodes after compilation.

### Verification Test 2: Expression Evaluation
Verify computed properties evaluate correctly at runtime.

### Verification Test 3: Phase Separation
Confirm no code generation occurs during Step 2c object processing.

## Related Issues

- **Original Bug Report**: "open mailbox" shows "It's already open" when mailbox should start closed
- **Memory Corruption**: test_attr (0x4A) corrupted to je (0x41)
- **Branch Polarity**: Conditional expressions evaluate incorrectly

# CURRENT ANALYSIS AND REVISED PLAN (November 1, 2025)

## Critical Discovery: Phase 2 Implementation is Broken

**Investigation Results**:
- Previous Phase 2 implementation exists but is non-functional
- Debug output shows: "üîÑ Phase 2: No computed property functions to generate"
- Computed properties are being stored as placeholder strings `__COMPUTED_mailbox_desc` instead of being registered as ComputedFunction
- The computed_property_manager has no functions registered

**Root Cause Identified**:
The Phase 1 (IR Generation) is broken - computed property expressions are never being registered with the computed_property_manager during object processing.

## Revised Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix IR Generation - Computed Property Registration ‚öôÔ∏è
**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: The computed property registration is failing during IR generation

#### Phase 1a: Diagnose Registration Failure
- [ ] **Find where computed properties should be registered**
  - Locate `generate_object()` processing of `desc` properties
  - Identify why ternary expressions become `__COMPUTED_mailbox_desc` strings instead of ComputedFunction entries
  - Fix the registration logic to actually store expressions in computed_property_manager

#### Phase 1b: Fix Registration Logic
- [ ] **Ensure computed expressions get registered properly**
  - When processing `desc: "text" + (object.open ? "open" : "closed") + "text"`
  - Store the ternary expression as ComputedFunction variant
  - Register function with computed_property_manager
  - Generate unique function names

**Verification**: Check that debug output shows computed functions being registered instead of "No computed property functions to generate"

### Phase 2: Fix Function Generation Pipeline üîß
**AFTER Phase 1 Complete**: Make sure registered computed properties become Z-Machine functions

#### Phase 2a: Verify Function Generation Works
- [ ] **Test that registered functions get compiled**
  - Verify compute_property_manager.get_functions() returns registered functions
  - Ensure functions get generated during Step 2f
  - Check function headers and bytecode generation

#### Phase 2b: Fix Function Generation Issues
- [ ] **Address any compilation errors in function generation**
  - Fix expression compilation within function context
  - Handle object references correctly
  - Generate proper return instructions

### Phase 3: Fix GetProperty Function Call Logic üõ°Ô∏è
**FINAL STEP**: Make GetProperty detect function addresses and call them

#### Phase 3a: Implement Function Address Detection
- [ ] **Complete the GetProperty fix**
  - Add logic to test if property value >= 10000 (function address)
  - If true, emit call_vs instruction to call the function
  - If false, use property value directly
  - Handle return value storage correctly

#### Phase 3b: End-to-End Testing
- [ ] **Verify complete pipeline works**
  - Test "examine mailbox" returns "closed" initially
  - Test "open mailbox" works without crashing
  - Test "examine mailbox" returns "open" after opening
  - Verify leaflet visibility changes

## Current Status Assessment

**What's Actually Working**:
- Game starts without crashing ‚úì
- Movement commands work ‚úì
- Basic property access works ‚úì

**What's Broken**:
- Computed property registration (Phase 1) ‚ùå
- Computed function generation (Phase 2) ‚ùå
- Computed function calling (Phase 3) ‚ùå

**Critical Path**: Fix Phase 1 first, then Phase 2, then Phase 3. No point fixing GetProperty when there are no computed functions to call.
