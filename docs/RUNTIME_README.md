## Finding Game Files

Gruesome plays Z-Machine game files (usually .z3, .z5, or .DAT extensions). You can find games at:
- Your original Infocom game disks
- The Interactive Fiction Archive
- Various preservation projects

Note: Please respect copyright and only play games you own or that are freely available.

## Troubleshooting

### "File not found" error
Make sure you're providing the correct path to the game file.

### Game doesn't start
Verify the game file is a valid Z-Machine file (version 3 works best).

### Text is garbled
The game file may be corrupted. Try obtaining it from another source.
