# Bug #22: Corrupted Object Property Table Addresses - Analysis & Fix Plan

## Problem Statement

When running mini_zork.z3, the interpreter reports 90+ "BOUNDS ERROR: prop_table_addr >= file size" errors at startup. Property table addresses point far beyond the file boundaries (0x2707, 0xe621, 0x94a5, etc.) instead of valid addresses (~0x0400-0x0600 range).

## Investigation Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Discovery (Oct 15, 2025 23:29)
- **Comprehensive gameplay test** revealed systematic corruption
- **ALL objects** have invalid property table pointers
- Game navigation works, but examining ANY object shows garbled text
- Inventory display completely corrupted

### Phase 2: Compilation Analysis (Oct 15, 2025 23:32)
- Property tables created correctly:
  ```
  obj#1 'yourself': prop_table=0x00ce
  obj#2 'West of House': prop_table=0x00d9
  ...
  obj#15 'egg': prop_table=0x0219
  ```
- Patching appears correct:
  ```
  obj#1: space_relative=0x00ce ‚Üí absolute=0x048a
  obj#2: space_relative=0x00d9 ‚Üí absolute=0x0495
  ...
  ```

### Phase 3: Hex Dump Analysis (Oct 15, 2025 23:30-23:35)

**Header**:
- Object table address (bytes 0x0A-0x0B): `03 bc` = 0x03bc ‚úì Correct

**Expected Layout**:
```
0x03bc: Property defaults (62 bytes, 0x3e)
0x03fa: First object entry (player)
```

**Actual Layout** (from hex dump):
```
0x03bc-0x03f9: Property defaults (all zeros) ‚úì Correct
0x03fa-0x03ff: SIX ZERO BYTES (unexpected gap!)
0x0400-0x0487: Object entries start HERE (6 bytes late!)
```

**Object Entry Analysis** (at 0x0400):
```
00000400: 00 04 8a 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 95 00 00 00 00
          ‚Üëattributes‚Üë ‚ÜëP ‚ÜëS ‚ÜëC ‚Üëprop_addr
```

Breaking down object #1 (V3 format: 4+1+1+1+2 = 9 bytes):
- Bytes 0x0400-0x0403: Attributes = `00 04 8a 00`  ‚Üê SUSPICIOUS!
- Byte  0x0404: Parent = `00`  ‚úì
- Byte  0x0405: Sibling = `00`  ‚úì
- Byte  0x0406: Child = `00`  ‚úì
- Bytes 0x0407-0x0408: Property table pointer = `04 95` = 0x0495  ‚úì CORRECT!

**Pattern Recognition**:
- Property table pointers ARE correct after patching (0x0495, 0x04b9, 0x04d6...)
- But there's a **6-byte offset** - objects should start at 0x03fa, they start at 0x0400
- This offset causes interpreter to read attribute bytes as property table pointers!

## Root Cause Hypothesis

**MISALIGNMENT IN OBJECT SPACE COPY**

When `object_space` is copied to `final_data`, there may be:
1. **Padding/alignment** added that shifts everything by 6 bytes
2. **Incorrect base address** calculation when copying object_space
3. **Header size mismatch** between what's written and what's expected

The fix correctly patches the property table pointers WITHIN the object entries, but the **object entries themselves** are 6 bytes offset from where the header says they should be.

## Debugging Plan

### Step 1: Trace Object Space Copy
**Goal**: Find where the 6-byte offset is introduced

**Actions**:
1. Add logging to `copy_object_space_to_final()` (or equivalent)
2. Log:
   - Source: `object_space.len()`, first 20 bytes
   - Destination: `final_data` offset where copied, first 20 bytes after copy
   - Expected object table address vs actual
3. Check if there's any padding or header bytes inserted

**Expected findings**:
- Object table header says 0x03bc
- Object space should be copied to start at 0x03bc in final_data
- Objects should start at 0x03bc + 0x3e = 0x03fa
- **Actual**: Objects appear at 0x0400 (6 bytes late)

### Step 2: Check Header Generation
**Goal**: Verify header object table pointer matches actual data location

**Actions**:
1. Log when header is written:
   - Object table address written to header
   - Where in final_data object_space is actually copied
2. Check for off-by-N errors in address calculation

### Step 3: Examine Object Space Content
**Goal**: Verify object_space has correct layout BEFORE copy

**Actions**:
1. Dump first 100 bytes of `object_space` after generation:
   ```rust
   log::error!("üîç OBJECT_SPACE dump: {:02x?}", &self.object_space[0..100]);
   ```
2. Verify:
   - Bytes 0x00-0x3d: Property defaults
   - Bytes 0x3e onwards: Object entries
   - No unexpected padding

### Step 4: Compare Expected vs Actual
**Goal**: Create side-by-side comparison of what SHOULD be vs what IS

**Expected** (object_space layout):
```
0x00-0x3d: Property defaults (62 bytes)
0x3e-0x46: Object #1 entry (9 bytes)
  - 0x3e-0x41: Attributes (4 bytes)
  - 0x42: Parent
  - 0x43: Sibling
  - 0x44: Child
  - 0x45-0x46: Property table pointer (space-relative, e.g., 0x00ce)
```

**Actual** (from hex dump at final address 0x03fa):
```
0x03fa-0x03ff: SIX ZERO BYTES ‚Üê BUG!
0x0400-0x0408: Object #1 entry (9 bytes)
  - 0x0400-0x0403: Attributes
  - 0x0404: Parent
  - 0x0405: Sibling
  - 0x0406: Child
  - 0x0407-0x0408: Property table pointer (absolute, 0x0495)
```

### Step 5: Find the Code Responsible
**Goal**: Locate exactly where object_space gets copied with wrong offset

**Candidate locations**:
1. `finalize()` or similar final assembly method
2. `copy_object_space()` or similar method
3. Header generation that writes object table address

**Search commands**:
```bash
grep -r "object_space.*final_data" src/
grep -r "copy.*object" src/ | grep -i space
grep -r "object_table_addr" src/ | grep -i write
```

## Fix Strategy

Once we find where the 6-byte offset is introduced:

**Option A: Fix the copy offset**
- If object_space is being copied 6 bytes too late, adjust the offset

**Option B: Fix the header address**
- If header is written with wrong address, add 6 to match actual location

**Option C: Fix object_space generation**
- If object_space has 6 bytes of unexpected padding at start, remove it

## Success Criteria

After fix:
1. ‚úÖ Object table header points to correct address
2. ‚úÖ Objects start immediately after property defaults (no gap)
3. ‚úÖ Property table pointers are correct
4. ‚úÖ No BOUNDS ERROR messages at startup
5. ‚úÖ "examine mailbox" shows proper description
6. ‚úÖ Inventory display shows proper item names
7. ‚úÖ All 183 tests pass

## Files to Examine

Priority order:
1. `src/grue_compiler/codegen.rs` - `patch_property_table_addresses()`, finalize methods
2. `src/grue_compiler/codegen_objects.rs` - object space generation
3. Header writing code (wherever object table address is written to bytes 0x0A-0x0B)

## Key Insight

**The property table patching is CORRECT!** The bug is NOT in `patch_property_table_addresses()`.

The bug is in the **ALIGNMENT** - object entries are 6 bytes offset from where the header says they should be. When the interpreter reads object #1 at the address in the header (0x03fa), it gets 6 zero bytes + the first 3 bytes of object #1's attributes. This garbage gets interpreted as the property table pointer, causing the BOUNDS ERROR.
