# Infocom Z-Machine Interpreter Project Guidelines

## Debugging Guidelines

For all debugging statements in this project, use the Rust `log` crate with `debug!` and `info!` macros instead of `println!`. This provides better control over debug output and follows Rust best practices.

### Usage:
- Use `debug!()` for detailed debugging information
- Use `info!()` for important runtime information
- Use `warn!()` for warnings
- Use `error!()` for errors

### Example:
```rust
use log::{debug, info};

// Instead of:
println!("Starting interpreter at PC: {:04x}", pc);

// Use:
info!("Starting interpreter at PC: {:04x}", pc);
```

### Object Debugging:
The `ObjectTable` struct has debug dump methods for inspecting Z-Machine objects:
- `debug_dump_object(obj_num)` - Dumps a specific object (1-based numbering)
- `debug_dump_all()` - Dumps all objects in the table

These methods show:
- Object number
- All 32 attribute flags (and which are set)
- Parent, sibling, and child relationships
- Description text
- All properties with their numbers and data

Example usage:
```rust
if let Some(obj_table) = game.get_object_table() {
    obj_table.debug_dump_object(1);  // Dump object #1
}
```

Example output:
```
[DEBUG infocom::zobject] === Object #1 ===
[DEBUG infocom::zobject]   Attributes: [14, 28]
[DEBUG infocom::zobject]   Set attributes: [4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13]
[DEBUG infocom::zobject]   Parent: 247
[DEBUG infocom::zobject]   Sibling: 2
[DEBUG infocom::zobject]   Child: 0
[DEBUG infocom::zobject]   Description: "pair of hands"
[DEBUG infocom::zobject]   Properties address: 0x0bb8
[DEBUG infocom::zobject]   Properties:
[DEBUG infocom::zobject]     Property 18: [70, 220, 66, 194, 66, 180] (len=6)
[DEBUG infocom::zobject]     Property 16: [130] (len=1)
```

## Project Structure

This is a Z-Machine interpreter implementation for playing Infocom text adventure games, starting with Zork I.

### Key Components:
- `vm.rs` - Virtual machine state (PC, stack, variables)
- `instruction.rs` - Instruction decoder for all Z-Machine instruction formats
- `interpreter.rs` - Main execution loop
- `disassembler.rs` - Debugging disassembler
- `opcode_tables.rs` - Opcode mappings per Z-Machine spec v1.1
- `zobject.rs` - Object system with debug dumping
- `game.rs` - Game file loading and parsing
- `header.rs` - Z-Machine file header parsing
- `dictionary.rs` - Game dictionary and text encoding

### Testing:
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests that load actual Zork I data file
- Test game file located at: `resources/test/zork1/DATA/ZORK1.DAT`

### Build and Test Commands:
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with debug output
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name -- --nocapture

# Format source code files
rustfmt src/*.rs

# Or format all Rust files in the project
cargo fmt
```

## NULL Call Handling

The interpreter correctly handles calls to address 0x0000 according to the Z-Machine specification:
- In `do_call()` function in interpreter.rs, there's a special check: `if packed_addr == 0`
- When calling address 0, it returns 0 (false) without executing any code
- This is NOT the source of the "w can you attack a spirit..." garbage text
- The garbage text comes from elsewhere in the execution flow after PERFORM returns

## Critical Game Execution Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: The Zork I game must follow the proper execution path to display correctly. Do NOT use workarounds or hacks that skip instructions.

### Expected Opening Display:
```
ZORK I: The Great Underground Empire

Revision 88 / Serial number 840726

You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.

```

### Common Execution Issues:
1. **Do NOT skip the intro sequence call at 0x4f82** - This prevents copyright text and revision/serial display
2. **Do NOT ignore instruction errors with hacks** - Fix the root cause instead
3. **Follow the disassembly execution path** - The working implementation shows the correct flow
4. **Implement proper SREAD** - Don't use hardcoded input that breaks game state

### Debugging Wrong Output:
If the game shows messages like "You are already standing, I think" or "Only bats can see in the dark" instead of the proper opening, this indicates:
- Wrong execution path from the start
- Skipped intro sequence 
- Broken piracy opcode handling
- Improper branch logic in early instructions

The fix is to remove workarounds and ensure proper instruction execution from PC 0x4f05.

## Important Zork I Object Information

### Object 4 (ADVENTURER / "cretin")
- This is a stub object that moves around the map
- Printed name: "cretin"
- Property 17 (ACTION): 00 00 (no function)
- This object represents the player's physical presence in game locations

### Object 5 (ME / "you")
- A global object which is always in scope
- Commands referring to ME hit this object, rather than ADVENTURER
- Property 17 (ACTION): 29 5c (has a valid action handler function)
- Because of this, parser messages mostly refer to you as "you", even though the ADVENTURER's printed name is "cretin"

### Key Insight
The game uses two separate objects for the player:
- Object 4 (ADVENTURER) for physical location tracking
- Object 5 (ME) for command processing and parser interactions

When processing commands, especially those with dictionary type 0x32 (like 'w'), the game checks property 17 (action handler) of objects. If object 4 is used instead of object 5, it will fail because object 4 has no action handler.
