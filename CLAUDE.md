# Infocom Z-Machine Interpreter Project Guidelines

## Z-Machine Specification Reference

The official Z-Machine Standards Document (v1.1) is available locally at:
`/Users/cb/Projects/Z-Machine-Standard/`

Key files:
- `sect07.html` - Output streams and buffering behavior
- `sect15.html` - Opcodes including read, read_char, buffer_mode
- `index.html` - Full specification index

**Critical Understanding**: Z-Machine "buffer mode" controls word-wrapping to prevent words from splitting across lines. It does NOT control display timing - all text should appear immediately.

## Input Echo Implementation (v1.2.0)

### Key Principles from Z-Machine Spec:
- **Section 7.1.1.1**: "In Versions 1 to 5, the player's input to the read opcode should be echoed to output streams 1 and 2"
- **Section 7.2**: Buffer mode is about word-wrapping, not display delay
- **Section 15.4**: "If input was terminated in the usual way, by the player typing a carriage return, then a carriage return is printed"

### Correct Implementation:
- All text appears immediately (no artificial buffering delays)
- Input characters echo in real-time as user types
- Newline printed when Enter pressed to terminate input
- Display thread polls at 16ms intervals for responsive updates

### Wrong Approaches to Avoid:
- Don't buffer text to delay display (this breaks input echo)
- Don't confuse Z-Machine buffer mode with display timing
- Don't skip the newline when input terminates normally

## CRITICAL FIX: VAR Opcode 0x13 Disambiguation

**PROBLEM**: Opcode 0x13 is used by TWO different instructions that share the same hex value:
- `get_next_prop` (2OP:19, hex 0x13) - **ALWAYS stores a result**
- `output_stream` (VAR:243, hex 0x13) - **NEVER stores a result**

**SOLUTION**: In the VAR section execute_var() method, distinguish using `inst.store_var`:

```rust
0x13 => {
    // This opcode can be either get_next_prop or output_stream in VAR form
    // get_next_prop stores a result, output_stream does not
    if inst.store_var.is_some() {
        // This is get_next_prop (VAR form of 2OP:19)
        let obj_num = operands[0];
        let prop_num = if operands.len() >= 2 { operands[1] as u8 } else { 0u8 };
        debug!("VAR get_next_prop: obj={:04x}, prop={}", obj_num, prop_num);
        let next_prop = self.vm.get_next_property(obj_num, prop_num)? as u16;
        if let Some(store_var) = inst.store_var {
            self.vm.write_variable(store_var, next_prop)?;
        }
        return Ok(ExecutionResult::Continue);
    }
    
    // output_stream (no result storage)
    // ... rest of output_stream implementation
}
```

**WHY THIS MATTERS**:
- AMFV calls VAR get_next_prop with 1 operand during startup
- Without this fix, AMFV crashes with "Unhandled object opcode: 13 with operand count VAR"
- Using heuristics (operand count, value ranges) breaks status line display
- Only the specification-compliant approach (checking store_var) works correctly

**NEVER use heuristics** - Always check the Z-Machine specification at `/Users/cb/Projects/Z-Machine-Standard/sect14.html` and `sect15.html` for the definitive opcode behavior.

## Debugging Guidelines

For all debugging statements in this project, use the Rust `log` crate with `debug!` and `info!` macros instead of `println!`. This provides better control over debug output and follows Rust best practices.

### Usage:
- Use `debug!()` for detailed debugging information
- Use `info!()` for important runtime information
- Use `warn!()` for warnings
- Use `error!()` for errors

### Example:
```rust
use log::{debug, info};

// Instead of:
println!("Starting interpreter at PC: {:04x}", pc);

// Use:
info!("Starting interpreter at PC: {:04x}", pc);
```

### Object Debugging:
The `ObjectTable` struct has debug dump methods for inspecting Z-Machine objects:
- `debug_dump_object(obj_num)` - Dumps a specific object (1-based numbering)
- `debug_dump_all()` - Dumps all objects in the table

These methods show:
- Object number
- All 32 attribute flags (and which are set)
- Parent, sibling, and child relationships
- Description text
- All properties with their numbers and data

Example usage:
```rust
if let Some(obj_table) = game.get_object_table() {
    obj_table.debug_dump_object(1);  // Dump object #1
}
```

Example output:
```
[DEBUG gruesome::zobject] === Object #1 ===
[DEBUG gruesome::zobject]   Attributes: [14, 28]
[DEBUG gruesome::zobject]   Set attributes: [4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13]
[DEBUG gruesome::zobject]   Parent: 247
[DEBUG gruesome::zobject]   Sibling: 2
[DEBUG gruesome::zobject]   Child: 0
[DEBUG gruesome::zobject]   Description: "pair of hands"
[DEBUG gruesome::zobject]   Properties address: 0x0bb8
[DEBUG gruesome::zobject]   Properties:
[DEBUG gruesome::zobject]     Property 18: [70, 220, 66, 194, 66, 180] (len=6)
[DEBUG gruesome::zobject]     Property 16: [130] (len=1)
```

## Timer System Implementation

### Timer System Analysis Summary

Zork I uses a sophisticated timer system for game elements like the lantern, matches, and candles. Based on extensive analysis:

1. **Timer Mechanism**: The SREAD instruction (opcode 0x04) accepts 4 operands:
   - text_buffer: where input text is stored
   - parse_buffer: where parsed tokens are stored  
   - time: timer in tenths of seconds (optional)
   - routine: interrupt routine address (optional)

2. **Timer Usage in Zork**: 71% of SREAD calls in Zork I use timers:
   - Common pattern: sread(text_buf, parse_buf, 10, 0x292c)
   - Timer fires every 1 second (10 tenths)
   - Interrupt routine at 0x5258 manages game timers

3. **Timer Variables**:
   - Global 88 (0x58): Lantern timer (~330 turns initially)
   - Global 89 (0x59): Match timer (very short)
   - Global 90 (0x5a): Candle timer (medium duration)

4. **How Timers Work**:
   - QUEUE routine (0x21fe) initializes timed events during game startup
   - Timer interrupt decrements counters (e.g., dec_chk G88)
   - Game logic checks thresholds for warnings/events
   - Lantern warnings at 30, 20, 10, 5 turns remaining
   - At 0, lantern goes out and room becomes dark

### Z-Machine Timer Specification (v1.1)

From the Z-Machine specification:

1. **Timer Support** (Version 4+):
   - `read` (sread) opcode accepts optional `time` and `routine` parameters
   - Timer specified in **tenths of seconds**
   - When timer expires, `routine()` is called with no parameters
   - If routine returns true: input erased and reading terminates
   - If routine returns false: input continues

2. **Header Flag**:
   - Flags 1, Bit 7 (offset 0x01): Indicates timed input support
   - Games check this to determine timer availability

3. **Implementation Requirements**:
   - Timer routines called asynchronously during input
   - Must handle screen output from timer routines
   - Redraw input line if timer printed anything
   - Cannot use save/save_undo in timer routines

### Rust Timer Implementation Patterns

1. **Async Approach (Tokio)**:
   - Use tokio::time::timeout for input with timeout
   - Spawn timer task that sends messages via channels
   - Work-stealing scheduler for efficiency

2. **Thread-based Approach**:
   - Spawn dedicated timer thread
   - Use channels (std::sync::mpsc or crossbeam) for communication
   - Timer thread sleeps and sends interrupts

3. **Terminal Input with Timeout**:
   - async-std provides io::timeout for stdin
   - timeout-readwrite crate adds timeout to readers
   - Standard library requires platform-specific code

### Recommended Implementation Strategy

For the Z-Machine interpreter, a **hybrid approach** is recommended:

1. **Input Thread**: Handle stdin in separate thread to avoid blocking
2. **Timer Thread**: Dedicated thread for timer management
3. **Channel Communication**: Use crossbeam channels for thread communication
4. **Interrupt Handling**: When timer expires, execute Z-Machine routine
5. **State Management**: Timer state is just global variables (no special handling)

This approach:
- Keeps the interpreter synchronous (easier to debug)
- Handles async input/timers without full async runtime
- Matches Z-Machine's interrupt model
- Allows proper input line redrawing after timer output

### Simplified Implementation Strategy (Current Approach)

After further analysis, we discovered that for turn-based games like Zork I, a much simpler approach works:

1. **Key Insight**: Most Z-Machine games are turn-based, not real-time
2. **Timer Usage**: Even though 71% of SREAD calls have timers, they're mainly for:
   - Turn-based counter updates (lantern, matches)
   - Status line updates
   - Housekeeping that can happen at turn boundaries

3. **Simplified Implementation**:
   ```rust
   fn sread_with_timer(&mut self, text_buffer: u16, parse_buffer: u16, 
                       time: u16, routine: u16) -> Result<ExecutionResult, String> {
       // Get input normally (blocking is fine)
       let input = self.get_user_input()?;
       
       // After input, simulate timer having fired once
       if time > 0 && routine > 0 {
           // Call timer routine once (as if it fired during input)
           let _result = self.call_timer_routine(routine)?;
           // Ignore result for now - don't terminate input
       }
       
       // Process input normally
       self.process_input(input, text_buffer, parse_buffer)
   }
   ```

4. **Why This Works**:
   - Every SREAD is a turn (correct for turn-based games)
   - Timer routines are idempotent for turn counting
   - No gameplay difference if counters update during vs after input
   - Lantern/match timers work correctly

5. **Limitations**:
   - Won't work for real-time games (Border Zone)
   - Status line won't update while user types
   - NPCs won't get impatient in real-time
   - But these don't affect Zork I gameplay

6. **Benefits**:
   - No threading complexity
   - Easy to debug and test
   - Can enhance later if real-time needed
   - Captures essential turn-based behavior

## NULL Call Handling

The interpreter correctly handles calls to address 0x0000 according to the Z-Machine specification:
- In `do_call()` function in interpreter.rs, there's a special check: `if packed_addr == 0`
- When calling address 0, it returns 0 (false) without executing any code
- This is NOT the source of the "w can you attack a spirit..." garbage text
- The garbage text comes from elsewhere in the execution flow after PERFORM returns

## Critical Game Execution Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: The Zork I game must follow the proper execution path to display correctly. Do NOT use workarounds or hacks that skip instructions.

### Expected Opening Display:
```
ZORK I: The Great Underground Empire
Copyright (c) 1981, 1982, 1983 Infocom, Inc. All rights reserved.
ZORK is a registered trademark of Infocom, Inc.
Revision 88 / Serial number 840726
 
West of House
You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.
There is a small mailbox here.

>
```

### Common Execution Issues:
1. **Do NOT skip the intro sequence call at 0x4f82** - This prevents copyright text and revision/serial display
2. **Do NOT ignore instruction errors with hacks** - Fix the root cause instead
3. **Follow the disassembly execution path** - The working implementation shows the correct flow
4. **Implement proper SREAD** - Don't use hardcoded input that breaks game state

### Debugging Wrong Output:
If the game shows messages like "You are already standing, I think" or "Only bats can see in the dark" instead of the proper opening, this indicates:
- Wrong execution path from the start
- Skipped intro sequence 
- Broken piracy opcode handling
- Improper branch logic in early instructions

The fix is to remove workarounds and ensure proper instruction execution from PC 0x4f05.

## Important Zork I Routines

### WORD-PRINT (0x5fda)
This routine prints a word from the text buffer character by character. It's called by BUFFER-PRINT
when displaying error messages like "You can't see any X here!".

The routine takes:
- Local 1: Word length
- Local 2: Starting position in text buffer

It uses a loop with `dec_chk` to print each character.

## Important Zork I Object Information

### Object 4 (ADVENTURER / "cretin")
- This is a stub object that moves around the map
- Printed name: "cretin"
- Property 17 (ACTION): 00 00 (no function)
- This object represents the player's physical presence in game locations

### Object 5 (ME / "you")
- A global object which is always in scope
- Commands referring to ME hit this object, rather than ADVENTURER
- Property 17 (ACTION): 29 5c (has a valid action handler function)
- Because of this, parser messages mostly refer to you as "you", even though the ADVENTURER's printed name is "cretin"

### Key Insight
The game uses two separate objects for the player:
- Object 4 (ADVENTURER) for physical location tracking
- Object 5 (ME) for command processing and parser interactions

When processing commands, especially those with dictionary type 0x32 (like 'w'), the game checks property 17 (action handler) of objects. If object 4 is used instead of object 5, it will fail because object 4 has no action handler.

## Architecture Refactoring Summary (Complete)

The Z-Machine interpreter has been successfully refactored with clean separation of version-specific concerns:

### ✅ **Completed Architecture Separation:**

#### 1. **Input System** - Fully Separated
- `input_v3.rs` - Simple line-based input for v3 games (stdin with echo)
- `input_v4.rs` - Advanced input with raw terminal mode for v4+ games (character & line input with timers)
- Version-specific selection in `interpreter.rs` based on game version

#### 2. **Object System** - Fully Separated  
- `zobject_v3.rs` - v3 format (255 objects, 32 attributes, 31 properties, 9-byte entries)
- `zobject_v4.rs` - v4+ format (65535 objects, 48 attributes, 63 properties, 14-byte entries)
- `zobject_interface.rs` - Common trait interface for version abstraction
- Automatic version detection and dispatch in `vm.rs`

#### 3. **Display System** - Fully Separated
- `display_v3.rs` - Simple status line display for v3 games
- `display_ratatui.rs` - Advanced windowing system for v4+ games (split windows, cursor control)
- `display_manager.rs` - Version-aware display selection with smart fallback
- `display_trait.rs` - Common interface across all display implementations

#### 4. **Dictionary System** - Version-Aware
- Single `dictionary.rs` with version-specific text encoding
- `encode_word_v3()` - 6 Z-characters in 4 bytes (2 words)
- `encode_word_v4_plus()` - 9 Z-characters in 6 bytes (3 words)  
- Automatic version detection in `lookup_dictionary()`

### 📊 **Architecture Success Metrics:**
- **95% separation achieved** - All major systems properly version-aware
- **Opcode system remains unified** - Version checks within `interpreter.rs` work well
- **Full functionality maintained** - Both v3 and v4+ games fully playable
- **Clean interfaces** - Trait-based abstraction allows easy extension

### 🔧 **Design Decisions:**
1. **Opcode refactoring deemed unnecessary** - Current `interpreter.rs` structure with version checks is clear and maintainable
2. **Trait-based abstraction** - Allows runtime version selection without code duplication
3. **Smart fallback systems** - Display and input gracefully degrade across environments
4. **Preserved existing APIs** - Refactoring maintains backward compatibility

The architecture now cleanly separates version-specific behavior while maintaining a unified, working interpreter that supports the full range of classic Infocom games.
