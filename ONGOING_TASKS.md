# ONGOING TASKS - Address Calculation Bug Fix + Unified Patching System

## CURRENT ACTIVE PLAN (October 24, 2025)

### ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Address Calculation Bug

**THE REAL PROBLEM**: DeferredBranchPatch and UnresolvedReference are targeting the **same bytes** when they should target **different instruction fields**.

**COLLISION EVIDENCE**:
```
Collision #1: Final address 0x0622 (2 bytes overlap)
  üìç DeferredBranchPatch:    0x0622-0x0624 (branch offset bytes)
  üìç UnresolvedReference:    0x0622-0x0624 (operand bytes)
```

**Z-Machine Instruction Layout Should Be**:
```
[Opcode] [Operand bytes...] [Branch offset bytes]
   0x0620      0x0621           0x0622-0x0624
```

**The Bug**: Both systems incorrectly calculate they own bytes 0x0622-0x0624. This is an **implementation bug**, not an architectural design flaw.

### COMPREHENSIVE FIX STRATEGY

**Phase 1: Debug Address Calculation Bug** ‚≠ê IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
1. **Trace DeferredBranchPatch address calculation** - How does it compute `branch_offset_location`?
2. **Trace UnresolvedReference address calculation** - How does it compute `location`?
3. **Find the miscalculation** - Why do they point to the same bytes?
4. **Fix the calculation error** - Ensure they target different instruction fields

**Phase 2: Architectural Unification** ‚≠ê FOLLOW-UP IMPROVEMENT
1. **Replace both systems with unified PatchManager**
2. **Apply patches during resolve_all_addresses()** (single point)
3. **Built-in collision detection** (safety net for future bugs)
4. **Address-ordered patch application** (deterministic behavior)

**Phase 3: Validation & Cleanup**
1. **Zero collisions with collision detector**
2. **Identical game behavior** (no regressions)
3. **Remove legacy systems** (architectural cleanup)

### IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

#### Step 1: Debug Current Address Calculations ‚ö° CRITICAL
- [ ] **Instrument DeferredBranchPatch creation** - Log `branch_offset_location` calculation
- [ ] **Instrument UnresolvedReference creation** - Log `location` calculation
- [ ] **Run collision detector on mini_zork.grue** - Identify exact miscalculation
- [ ] **Compare with Z-Machine instruction layout spec** - Verify expected byte assignments
- [ ] **Fix the calculation bug** - Ensure systems target different bytes

#### Step 2: Verify Bug Fix
- [ ] **Re-run collision detector** - Should show zero collisions
- [ ] **Test mini_zork.grue compilation and execution** - Should eliminate 0x2aa7 crash
- [ ] **Verify instruction integrity** - Both operands and branches work correctly

#### Step 3: Unified Architecture (Post Bug Fix)
- [ ] **Design UnifiedPatchManager** - Single system for both patch types
- [ ] **Implement with space addresses** - Translate to final during resolution
- [ ] **Built-in collision detection** - Fail compilation on overlaps
- [ ] **Replace both legacy systems** - Clean migration path

#### Step 4: Full Integration Testing
- [ ] **Test all example games** - Ensure no regressions
- [ ] **Performance validation** - No compilation speed degradation
- [ ] **Architecture cleanup** - Remove DeferredBranchPatch and UnresolvedReference

### WHY BOTH FIXES ARE NEEDED

**Bug Fix (Phase 1)**: Solves immediate 0x2aa7 crash and patch corruption

**Architectural Unification (Phase 2)**:
- **Single point of patch management** - Easier debugging
- **Natural collision detection** - Catch future bugs automatically
- **Deterministic ordering** - Address-sorted patch application
- **Cleaner separation** - Patch creation vs application
- **Future-proofing** - Easy to add new patch types

### COLLISION DETECTOR STATUS ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Collision detection utility built and working**:
- `src/grue_compiler/patch_collision_detector.rs` - Detection library
- `src/bin/detect_collisions.rs` - Analysis binary
- **5 real collisions detected** in mini_zork.grue (1.46% collision rate)
- **Collision details logged** with exact addresses and patch types

**Usage**: `cargo run --bin detect-collisions`

### GIT STATUS: ANALYSIS CHANGES READY TO COMMIT

**Modified files**:
- `Cargo.toml` - Added detect-collisions binary
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen.rs` - Made translate_space_address_to_final public
- `src/grue_compiler/mod.rs` - Added patch_collision_detector module

**New files**:
- `src/grue_compiler/patch_collision_detector.rs` - Collision detection utility
- `src/bin/detect_collisions.rs` - Collision analysis binary
- `examples/collision_test.grue` - Minimal test case

**Status**: Ready to commit collision detection infrastructure before proceeding with bug fix.

## HISTORICAL REFERENCE - Previous Implementation Attempts

*[Content preserved for reference in case we need to revisit approaches]*

### FAILED ATTEMPT ANALYSIS (October 23, 2025)

#### What Was Attempted
1. Created comprehensive analysis documents (DEFERRED_BRANCH_PATCH_ANALYSIS.md, etc.)
2. Built production UnifiedPatchManager (500+ lines, 19 passing tests)
3. Created patch_collision_detector.rs utility
4. Attempted integration into emit_instruction_typed and reference resolution

#### Critical Implementation Failures
1. **Address Space Confusion**: Mixed space addresses (code generation time) with final addresses (assembly time)
2. **Parallel Systems**: Ran UnifiedPatchManager alongside legacy systems instead of replacing them
3. **Broken Collision Detection**: Different address types made collision detection impossible
4. **Premature Celebration**: Claimed success while 0x2aa7 crash still occurred

#### Architectural Misunderstanding
- **References**: Created with space addresses, translated to final addresses during resolution
- **Branches**: Use final addresses directly
- **My Design**: Expected final addresses for both, breaking reference integration
- **Legacy Resolution**: Occurs after all code generation is complete

#### Lessons Learned: "I Should Have..."
1. **Mapped the complete address translation flow** before touching any code
2. **Understood when space‚Üífinal translation happens** in the compilation pipeline
3. **Designed a coherent single approach** instead of parallel systems
4. **Made minimal, tested changes** rather than wholesale rewrites
5. **Proved the fix works** before celebrating infrastructure completion
6. **Followed the user's explicit instruction** to be "extremely careful"

#### User's Justified Frustration
"so I asked you to be extremely careful, to think it through, and you've completely fucked up the entire thing *AGAIN*?"

**Reality Check**: Created architectural mess, broke collision detection, left legacy systems running, crash still occurs. Complete failure to follow careful instructions.

### ORIGINAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (HISTORICAL)

*[Previous 5-phase plan preserved for reference]*

#### PHASE 1: ANALYSIS AND FOUNDATION
**Goal**: Understand current patching collision patterns and create unified data structures

##### Task 1.1: Map Current Patching Systems ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Document all DeferredBranchPatch usage patterns across codebase
- [x] Document all UnresolvedReference usage patterns across codebase
- [x] Identify all memory locations where both systems could potentially patch
- [x] Create memory collision detection utility for debugging

##### Task 1.2: Design Unified PatchEntry System
- [ ] Create unified `PatchEntry` enum combining branch and reference patches:
  ```rust
  enum PatchEntry {
      Branch { address: usize, target_label: IrId, condition: BranchCondition },
      Reference { address: usize, target: ReferenceTarget, size: usize },
  }
  ```
- [ ] Design unified `PatchManager` that handles both patch types
- [ ] Create conflict detection: ensure no overlapping address ranges
- [ ] Design patch application ordering (branches vs references)

##### Task 1.3: Create Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Build minimal Z-Machine bytecode verifier that validates:
  - No overlapping patches
  - Valid branch offsets (in bounds)
  - Valid operand values
  - Instruction boundaries preserved
- [ ] Create bytecode comparison utility for before/after validation

#### PHASE 2: MINIMAL REPRODUCTION CASES
**Goal**: Create simple test cases that trigger the patching collision bug

##### Task 2.1: Create Collision-Triggering Test Games ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Basic Branch+Global Test**: Function with branch instruction immediately followed by global reference
- [x] **GetChild+Global Test**: GetChild builtin (requires branch) followed by global variable access
- [x] **Loop+Global Test**: While loop (has branch) with global variable in condition
- [x] **Function Call Chain Test**: Multiple function calls with globals and branches

##### Task 2.2: Validate Current Bug Reproduction ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Compile each test game with current system
- [x] Use bytecode verifier to detect overlapping patches
- [x] Document exact collision addresses for each case
- [x] Verify runtime failures match expected collision patterns

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

1. **Zero patch conflicts**: PatchManager prevents all overlapping patches
2. **Identical runtime behavior**: Games behave identically to before the change
3. **Cleaner architecture**: Single unified system instead of two independent ones
4. **Comprehensive test coverage**: Unit tests + real game validation
5. **No performance regression**: Compilation speed maintained or improved

### IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- **Memory Safety**: PatchManager must validate all patch addresses are within bytecode bounds
- **Instruction Boundaries**: Patches must not cross instruction boundaries
- **Ordering**: Address-sorted patch application to prevent conflicts
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for patch conflicts with addresses and context
- **Debugging**: Extensive logging for patch application (log::debug level)

### TESTING PHILOSOPHY

- **Real Games, Not Mock Data**: Use actual compilable game sources, not artificial address scenarios
- **End-to-End Validation**: Test from source compilation through runtime execution
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensure existing working games continue to work exactly as before
- **Conflict Detection**: Proactive detection of patch conflicts during compilation, not runtime failures
