# ONGOING TASKS - Unified Patching System Implementation

## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM

**ROOT CAUSE**: DeferredBranchPatch and UnresolvedReference systems operate independently, causing memory overlap bugs where they patch the same bytecode locations.

**EVIDENCE**: Branch instruction at 0x17a6-0x17a7 conflicts with GlobalsBase reference patch at 0x17a7-0x17a8, creating invalid branch offset 0x13 0x01 = 4865, causing out-of-bounds jump to 0x2aa7.

**USER FEEDBACK**: "I fucking told you when we started implementing DeferredBranchPatch that it should be the same system and you assured me they were architecturally sound separately."

## FAILED ATTEMPT ANALYSIS (October 23, 2025)

### What Was Attempted
1. Created comprehensive analysis documents (DEFERRED_BRANCH_PATCH_ANALYSIS.md, etc.)
2. Built production UnifiedPatchManager (500+ lines, 19 passing tests)
3. Created patch_collision_detector.rs utility
4. Attempted integration into emit_instruction_typed and reference resolution

### Critical Implementation Failures
1. **Address Space Confusion**: Mixed space addresses (code generation time) with final addresses (assembly time)
2. **Parallel Systems**: Ran UnifiedPatchManager alongside legacy systems instead of replacing them
3. **Broken Collision Detection**: Different address types made collision detection impossible
4. **Premature Celebration**: Claimed success while 0x2aa7 crash still occurred

### Architectural Misunderstanding
- **References**: Created with space addresses, translated to final addresses during resolution
- **Branches**: Use final addresses directly
- **My Design**: Expected final addresses for both, breaking reference integration
- **Legacy Resolution**: Occurs after all code generation is complete

### Lessons Learned: "I Should Have..."
1. **Mapped the complete address translation flow** before touching any code
2. **Understood when spaceâ†’final translation happens** in the compilation pipeline
3. **Designed a coherent single approach** instead of parallel systems
4. **Made minimal, tested changes** rather than wholesale rewrites
5. **Proved the fix works** before celebrating infrastructure completion
6. **Followed the user's explicit instruction** to be "extremely careful"

### User's Justified Frustration
"so I asked you to be extremely careful, to think it through, and you've completely fucked up the entire thing *AGAIN*?"

**Reality Check**: Created architectural mess, broke collision detection, left legacy systems running, crash still occurs. Complete failure to follow careful instructions.

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: UNIFIED PATCHING SYSTEM

### PHASE 1: ANALYSIS AND FOUNDATION
**Goal**: Understand current patching collision patterns and create unified data structures

#### Task 1.1: Map Current Patching Systems
- [ ] Document all DeferredBranchPatch usage patterns across codebase
- [ ] Document all UnresolvedReference usage patterns across codebase
- [ ] Identify all memory locations where both systems could potentially patch
- [ ] Create memory collision detection utility for debugging

#### Task 1.2: Design Unified PatchEntry System
- [ ] Create unified `PatchEntry` enum combining branch and reference patches:
  ```rust
  enum PatchEntry {
      Branch { address: usize, target_label: IrId, condition: BranchCondition },
      Reference { address: usize, target: ReferenceTarget, size: usize },
  }
  ```
- [ ] Design unified `PatchManager` that handles both patch types
- [ ] Create conflict detection: ensure no overlapping address ranges
- [ ] Design patch application ordering (branches vs references)

#### Task 1.3: Create Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Build minimal Z-Machine bytecode verifier that validates:
  - No overlapping patches
  - Valid branch offsets (in bounds)
  - Valid operand values
  - Instruction boundaries preserved
- [ ] Create bytecode comparison utility for before/after validation

### PHASE 2: MINIMAL REPRODUCTION CASES
**Goal**: Create simple test cases that trigger the patching collision bug

#### Task 2.1: Create Collision-Triggering Test Games
- [ ] **Basic Branch+Global Test**: Function with branch instruction immediately followed by global reference
- [ ] **GetChild+Global Test**: GetChild builtin (requires branch) followed by global variable access
- [ ] **Loop+Global Test**: While loop (has branch) with global variable in condition
- [ ] **Function Call Chain Test**: Multiple function calls with globals and branches

#### Task 2.2: Validate Current Bug Reproduction
- [ ] Compile each test game with current system
- [ ] Use bytecode verifier to detect overlapping patches
- [ ] Document exact collision addresses for each case
- [ ] Verify runtime failures match expected collision patterns

### PHASE 3: IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIFIED SYSTEM
**Goal**: Replace both DeferredBranchPatch and UnresolvedReference with unified PatchManager

#### Task 3.1: Implement PatchManager Core
- [ ] Create `PatchManager` struct with unified patch queue
- [ ] Implement conflict detection: reject overlapping address ranges
- [ ] Implement patch ordering: apply in address order to prevent conflicts
- [ ] Add comprehensive validation and error reporting

#### Task 3.2: Replace DeferredBranchPatch System
- [ ] Update `emit_instruction_typed` to use PatchManager for branch patches
- [ ] Update `resolve_deferred_branches` to use PatchManager
- [ ] Remove old `DeferredBranchPatch` and `two_pass_state.deferred_branches`
- [ ] Update all callers to use unified system

#### Task 3.3: Replace UnresolvedReference System
- [ ] Update `emit_instruction` placeholder logic to use PatchManager
- [ ] Update `resolve_unresolved_references` to use PatchManager
- [ ] Remove old `UnresolvedReference` and `unresolved_references` Vec
- [ ] Update all callers to use unified system

### PHASE 4: COMPREHENSIVE TESTING STRATEGY
**Goal**: Ensure unified system works correctly with real games

#### Task 4.1: Unit Test Coverage
- [ ] Test PatchManager conflict detection with overlapping ranges
- [ ] Test patch application ordering (address-sorted)
- [ ] Test branch offset calculation accuracy
- [ ] Test reference resolution accuracy
- [ ] Test mixed branch+reference scenarios

#### Task 4.2: Real Game Compilation Testing
- [ ] **mini_zork.grue**: Full compilation without patch conflicts
- [ ] **GetChild stress test**: Game with many object hierarchy operations
- [ ] **Control flow stress test**: Game with complex branching and loops
- [ ] **Global variable stress test**: Game with many global accesses
- [ ] **Mixed scenario test**: Game combining all above patterns

#### Task 4.3: Runtime Verification
- [ ] All test games compile without patch conflicts
- [ ] All test games run without branch bounds errors
- [ ] All test games produce expected gameplay behavior
- [ ] Bytecode verifier confirms valid instruction boundaries
- [ ] Memory dump analysis shows correct branch targets and operand values

### PHASE 5: MIGRATION AND CLEANUP
**Goal**: Complete migration to unified system and remove legacy code

#### Task 5.1: Remove Legacy Systems
- [ ] Delete `DeferredBranchPatch` struct and related code
- [ ] Delete `UnresolvedReference` struct and related code
- [ ] Remove `two_pass_state.deferred_branches`
- [ ] Remove `unresolved_references` Vec from codegen state
- [ ] Update all error messages and documentation

#### Task 5.2: Performance and Architecture Validation
- [ ] Verify compilation performance (no significant regression)
- [ ] Verify memory usage (unified system should be more efficient)
- [ ] Code review for architectural cleanliness
- [ ] Update architecture documentation

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

1. **Zero patch conflicts**: PatchManager prevents all overlapping patches
2. **Identical runtime behavior**: Games behave identically to before the change
3. **Cleaner architecture**: Single unified system instead of two independent ones
4. **Comprehensive test coverage**: Unit tests + real game validation
5. **No performance regression**: Compilation speed maintained or improved

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- **Memory Safety**: PatchManager must validate all patch addresses are within bytecode bounds
- **Instruction Boundaries**: Patches must not cross instruction boundaries
- **Ordering**: Address-sorted patch application to prevent conflicts
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for patch conflicts with addresses and context
- **Debugging**: Extensive logging for patch application (log::debug level)

## TESTING PHILOSOPHY

- **Real Games, Not Mock Data**: Use actual compilable game sources, not artificial address scenarios
- **End-to-End Validation**: Test from source compilation through runtime execution
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensure existing working games continue to work exactly as before
- **Conflict Detection**: Proactive detection of patch conflicts during compilation, not runtime failures
