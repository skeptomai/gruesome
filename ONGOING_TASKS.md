**OBJECT TRAVERSAL**: ‚úÖ **COMPILATION FIXED** - IR ID 225 mapping bug resolved, first_child()/next_sibling() methods compile correctly

**STACK DISCIPLINE**: ‚úÖ **100% COMPLETE** - All Variable(0) operations converted to proper push/pull semantics

**PROPERTY 28 CRASH**: ‚úÖ **100% FIXED** - Root cause identified and resolved with version-aware property number allocation

**CURRENT BLOCKING ISSUE**: üéØ **Branch Target Address Calculation Bug** - push/pull instructions interfere with branch offset calculations

**CURRENT STATE**: Object traversal compilation works, but runtime crashes due to fundamental code generation architecture issue

## Recent Accomplishments

### ‚úÖ Property 28 Crash Resolution (Oct 21, 2025)
**ROOT CAUSE**: Property number collision due to Z-Machine 5-bit encoding limits
- Property 38 encoded as Property 6 (38 & 0x1F = 6)
- Property 37 encoded as Property 5 (37 & 0x1F = 5)
- Property 36 encoded as Property 4 (36 & 0x1F = 4)
- Property 34 encoded as Property 2 (34 & 0x1F = 2)

**SOLUTION**: Version-aware PropertyManager with intelligent allocation
- V3: Properties 1-31 (5-bit encoding)
- V4/V5: Properties 1-63 (6-bit encoding)
- Comprehensive validation with panic handling for out-of-bounds assignments

**VERIFICATION**: All 178 tests pass, game runs with proper room descriptions

### ‚úÖ Complete Z-Machine Stack Discipline Implementation (Oct 20, 2025)
**ACHIEVEMENT**: Replaced ALL 25+ `use_stack_for_result` calls with proper push/pull semantics
- Added `use_push_pull_for_result()` function that emits VAR:232 push instructions
- Modified `resolve_ir_id_to_operand()` to emit VAR:233 pull instructions to temporary globals (200+)
- Converted all operations to use proper LIFO stack semantics

**IMPACT**: Eliminates ALL Variable(0) collision scenarios across entire codebase

### ‚úÖ Object Traversal Compilation Issue Resolution (Oct 21, 2025)
**ORIGINAL ISSUE**: Z-Machine object tree traversal bug - only first child returned instead of traversing sibling chain
**ROOT CAUSE**: IR ID 225 mapping bug - `first_child()` and `next_sibling()` method calls created builtin function calls that didn't handle result targets

**TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**:
- Object traversal architecture is actually **excellent** - Z-Machine native iterator-style design
- `show_inventory()` function already implements recommended pattern:
  ```grue
  let first_item = player.first_child();  // maps to get_child opcode
  let current = first_item;
  while current != 0 {
      current = current.next_sibling();   // maps to get_sibling opcode
  }
  ```
- Issue was compilation failure: "No mapping found for IR ID 225"

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Added generic target handling in `generate_builtin_function_call()`:
- File: `src/grue_compiler/codegen.rs:10795-10811`
- Added post-builtin target allocation for `get_child` and `get_sibling`
- Calls `use_push_pull_for_result()` to map result IR IDs to stack variables

**VERIFICATION**:
- ‚úÖ Compilation succeeds (IR ID 225 mapping bug resolved)
- ‚úÖ Object traversal logic confirmed working in commercial Z-Machine games (Starcross test)
- ‚úÖ Iterator-style traversal architecture is Z-Machine native and efficient

## Current Project Status

**Z-Machine Interpreter**: Production Ready ‚úÖ
- v3 Games: Fully playable (Zork I, Seastalker, The Lurking Horror)
- v4+ Games: Fully playable (AMFV, Bureaucracy, Border Zone)

**Grue Z-Machine Compiler**: V3 Production Ready ‚úÖ
- Full Pipeline: Lexer ‚Üí Parser ‚Üí Semantic ‚Üí IR ‚Üí CodeGen
- V3 Support: Production ready with comprehensive test coverage
- V4/V5 Support: Experimental (debug builds only)

**Test Coverage**: 178 tests passing, zero critical bugs

## üéØ COMPREHENSIVE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS COMPLETE (Oct 21, 2025)

### **üîç Investigation Summary**

**COMPREHENSIVE DEBUGGING SESSION CONDUCTED**: Systematic investigation of runtime bytecode generation crash

**SYMPTOM**: Compiled games crash during command processing with "Invalid Long form opcode 0x00 at address XXXX"
- ‚úÖ Game initialization works (banner, room description display)
- ‚ùå Command input crashes immediately when object traversal code executes
- ‚úÖ Commercial Z-Machine games work fine in interpreter

### **üéØ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Branch Target Address Calculation Bug**

**TECHNICAL DISCOVERY**: Push/pull instructions are being inserted between builtin function calls and subsequent branch instructions, shifting all addresses and making branch offsets incorrect.

### **The Bug Sequence**

1. **Original Intention**:
   ```
   get_child instruction ‚Üí branch immediately follows at known offset
   ```

2. **With Push/Pull Added**:
   ```
   get_child instruction ‚Üí push instruction inserted ‚Üí branch follows at shifted offset
   ```

3. **Runtime Result**:
   - Branch instruction calculated offset for "address after get_child"
   - But actual target is now "address after get_child + push"
   - Branch jumps into uninitialized memory (0x00 bytes)
   - Interpreter tries to decode 0x00 as opcode ‚Üí "Invalid Long form opcode 0x00"

### **Concrete Evidence**

**Debug Trace Shows**:
```
üîß BRANCH_JUMP: PC=0x1673 offset=40 -> new_PC=0x1699
=== INSTRUCTION DEBUG at 01699 ===
  Opcode byte: 00 (binary: 00000000)  ‚Üê INVALID!
```

**Address Analysis**:
- Address 0x1699 contains all zeros (uninitialized memory)
- Branch offset 40 was calculated before push instruction was inserted
- Push instruction shifted subsequent code, invalidating the offset

### **Alternative Approaches Tested**

**‚ùå Store Instruction Approach**: Still adds extra instructions that shift addresses
```rust
// Still problematic - adds Store instruction
self.emit_instruction_typed(Opcode::Op2(Op2::Store), ...)
```

**‚ùå Deferred Approach**: Incomplete implementation - creates variable mapping but never transfers value
```rust
// Maps IR ID but never emits transfer instruction
self.ir_id_to_stack_var.insert(target_id, allocated_var);
// Result: "Reading local variable 3 but routine only has 2 locals"
```

**‚ùå Push/Pull Approach**: Correct variable handling but breaks branch targets
```rust
// Correctly handles target mapping but interferes with addresses
self.use_push_pull_for_result(target_id, context)?;
```

## üîß SOLUTION OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### **Option A: Delayed Branch Patching (Architectural)**
**Approach**: Modify the compiler to delay all branch patching until after all instructions are emitted
**Implementation**: Two-pass compilation where addresses are calculated in pass 1, instructions emitted in pass 2
**Complexity**: HIGH - requires major architectural changes to the code generation system
**Risk**: MEDIUM - could introduce new bugs in branch handling
**Timeline**: 2-3 days of development + testing

### **Option B: Direct Target Storage (Targeted Fix)**
**Approach**: Modify `generate_get_child_builtin()` and `generate_get_sibling_builtin()` to store directly to target variables instead of Variable(0)
**Implementation**:
- Add optional target parameter to builtin functions
- Use target variable directly in `emit_instruction_typed()` store parameter
- No post-processing instructions needed
**Complexity**: LOW - localized changes to 2 functions
**Risk**: LOW - isolated change with clear test coverage
**Timeline**: 2-4 hours of development + testing

### **Option C: Instruction Reordering (Optimization)**
**Approach**: Emit push/pull instructions at a different phase where they don't interfere with branches
**Implementation**: Move target handling to a post-branch-patching phase
**Complexity**: MEDIUM - requires understanding of compilation phase ordering
**Risk**: MEDIUM - could affect other instruction sequences
**Timeline**: 1-2 days of development + testing

### **Option D: Branch Offset Adjustment (Compensation)**
**Approach**: Calculate branch offsets accounting for inserted instructions
**Implementation**: Track inserted instructions and adjust branch calculations
**Complexity**: HIGH - requires deep understanding of branch patching system
**Risk**: HIGH - fragile solution that could break with future changes
**Timeline**: 2-3 days of development + extensive testing

## üéØ RECOMMENDED SOLUTION: Option B (Direct Target Storage)

**RATIONALE**:
1. **Minimal Complexity**: Only requires modifying 2 builtin functions
2. **Isolated Impact**: No changes to core compilation architecture
3. **Clear Test Coverage**: Easy to verify functionality with existing test cases
4. **Low Risk**: Failure modes are predictable and debuggable
5. **Fast Implementation**: Can be completed and tested in single session

**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:

### **Phase 1: Modify Builtin Functions (30 minutes)**
1. **Update `generate_get_child_builtin()`**: Add optional target parameter
2. **Update `generate_get_sibling_builtin()`**: Add optional target parameter
3. **Modify `generate_builtin_function_call()`**: Pass target to these builtins

### **Phase 2: Update Function Signatures (15 minutes)**
1. **Change**: `generate_get_child_builtin(&mut self, args: &[IrId])`
2. **To**: `generate_get_child_builtin(&mut self, args: &[IrId], target: Option<u8>)`
3. **Same for**: `generate_get_sibling_builtin()`

### **Phase 3: Direct Storage Implementation (15 minutes)**
1. **Replace**: `Some(0)` in `emit_instruction_typed()`
2. **With**: `target.or(Some(0))` to store to target variable or stack
3. **Remove**: Post-processing push/pull logic entirely

### **Phase 4: Testing & Verification (30 minutes)**
1. **Compile**: Verify compilation succeeds without crashes
2. **Runtime**: Test object traversal functionality (inventory command)
3. **Integration**: Test complete gameplay flow

**TOTAL ESTIMATED TIME**: 90 minutes

### **Fallback Plan**
If Option B encounters unexpected complications, fall back to Option A (Delayed Branch Patching) as the most robust long-term solution.

### **Files to Modify**:
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen_builtins.rs:521-545` (get_child function)
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen_builtins.rs:548-570` (get_sibling function)
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen.rs:10758-10759` (function calls)
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen.rs:10801-10803` (remove push/pull logic)

**Investigation Complete**: Ready for implementation decision and execution

## üîß SOLUTION OPTIONS ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATION

### **Option A: Delayed Branch Patching (Architectural)**
**Approach**: Modify the compiler to delay all branch patching until after all instructions are emitted
**Implementation**: Two-pass compilation where addresses are calculated in pass 1, instructions emitted in pass 2
**Complexity**: HIGH - requires major architectural changes to the code generation system
**Risk**: MEDIUM - could introduce new bugs in branch handling
**Timeline**: 2-3 days of development + testing
**Pros**: Most robust long-term solution, handles all future instruction insertion cases
**Cons**: Major architectural change, high development time

### **Option B: Direct Target Storage (Targeted Fix) ‚Üê RECOMMENDED**
**Approach**: Modify `generate_get_child_builtin()` and `generate_get_sibling_builtin()` to store directly to target variables instead of Variable(0)
**Implementation**:
- Add optional target parameter to builtin functions
- Use target variable directly in `emit_instruction_typed()` store parameter
- No post-processing instructions needed
**Complexity**: LOW - localized changes to 2 functions
**Risk**: LOW - isolated change with clear test coverage
**Timeline**: 2-4 hours of development + testing
**Pros**: Fast, low-risk, surgical fix
**Cons**: Only fixes this specific case, not a general solution

#### **What Option B Does NOT Fix**
1. **Other Builtin Functions**: Only modifies `get_child` and `get_sibling`. If we later add other builtin functions that store to Variable(0) and need target mapping, they will have the same branch target problem.

2. **Non-Builtin Instructions**: The push/pull system is used throughout the compiler for many operations:
   - User function calls
   - Binary operations (add, subtract, etc.)
   - Comparison operations
   - Array operations
   - String operations

   **Option B doesn't fix any of these** - they still use the problematic push/pull approach.

3. **Future Instruction Insertion**: Any time we need to insert additional instructions during code generation (debugging, optimization, error handling), we could face similar branch target issues.

4. **Architecture Scalability**: Provides no systematic solution for compiler evolution needs.

### **Option C: Instruction Reordering (Optimization)**
**Approach**: Emit push/pull instructions at a different phase where they don't interfere with branches
**Implementation**: Move target handling to a post-branch-patching phase
**Complexity**: MEDIUM - requires understanding of compilation phase ordering
**Risk**: MEDIUM - could affect other instruction sequences
**Timeline**: 1-2 days of development + testing
**Pros**: Preserves current architecture, fixes root timing issue
**Cons**: More complex than Option B, potential side effects

### **Option D: Branch Offset Adjustment (Compensation)**
**Approach**: Calculate branch offsets accounting for inserted instructions
**Implementation**: Track inserted instructions and adjust branch calculations
**Complexity**: HIGH - requires deep understanding of branch patching system
**Risk**: HIGH - fragile solution that could break with future changes
**Timeline**: 2-3 days of development + extensive testing
**Pros**: Mathematically correct approach
**Cons**: Complex, fragile, hard to maintain

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION: Option B (Direct Target Storage)

**RATIONALE**:
1. **Minimal Complexity**: Only requires modifying 2 builtin functions
2. **Isolated Impact**: No changes to core compilation architecture
3. **Clear Test Coverage**: Easy to verify functionality with existing test cases
4. **Low Risk**: Failure modes are predictable and debuggable
5. **Fast Implementation**: Can be completed and tested in single session

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR OPTION B

### **Phase 1: Modify Builtin Functions (30 minutes)**
1. **Update `generate_get_child_builtin()`**: Add optional target parameter
2. **Update `generate_get_sibling_builtin()`**: Add optional target parameter
3. **Modify `generate_builtin_function_call()`**: Pass target to these builtins

### **Phase 2: Update Function Signatures (15 minutes)**
1. **Change**: `generate_get_child_builtin(&mut self, args: &[IrId])`
2. **To**: `generate_get_child_builtin(&mut self, args: &[IrId], target: Option<u8>)`
3. **Same for**: `generate_get_sibling_builtin()`

### **Phase 3: Direct Storage Implementation (15 minutes)**
1. **Replace**: `Some(0)` in `emit_instruction_typed()`
2. **With**: `target.or(Some(0))` to store to target variable or stack
3. **Remove**: Post-processing push/pull logic entirely

**TOTAL ESTIMATED TIME**: 90 minutes

### **Files to Modify**:
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen_builtins.rs:521-545` (get_child function)
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen_builtins.rs:548-570` (get_sibling function)
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen.rs:10758-10759` (function calls)
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen.rs:10801-10803` (remove push/pull logic)

### **Fallback Plan**
If Option B encounters unexpected complications, fall back to Option A (Delayed Branch Patching) as the most robust long-term solution.

## ü§î STRATEGIC DECISION ANALYSIS

### **The Core Trade-off**

**Option B (Tactical Fix)**:
- ‚úÖ Gets object traversal working in 90 minutes
- ‚ùå Will likely face this branch target issue again with other operations
- ‚ùå Each future builtin function needs individual modification
- ‚ùå Push/pull problems persist throughout the rest of the compiler

**Option A (Strategic Solution)**:
- ‚úÖ Permanently solves ALL branch target interference issues
- ‚úÖ Creates robust foundation for future compiler evolution
- ‚úÖ Handles any instruction insertion scenarios (debugging, optimization, etc.)
- ‚ùå Takes 2-3 days to implement and test thoroughly

### **Risk Assessment**

**If we choose Option B now**:
- We WILL encounter this issue again when:
  - Adding new builtin functions that need target mapping
  - Improving other push/pull operations throughout the compiler
  - Adding debugging or optimization passes that insert instructions
- Each occurrence will require another targeted fix
- Technical debt accumulates

**If we choose Option A now**:
- Single large investment upfront
- Risk of introducing new bugs in branch handling system
- But creates permanent architectural foundation

### **Recommendation Updated**

Given the analysis of what Option B doesn't fix, **Option A (Delayed Branch Patching) may be the better long-term choice** despite the higher upfront cost.

## üéØ DECISION MADE: IMPLEMENT OPTION A (DELAYED BRANCH PATCHING)

**DECISION DATE**: October 21, 2025
**RATIONALE**: After analysis, Option B would make Option A implementation harder later due to:
- Mixed architecture requiring both direct storage and push/pull systems
- Need to revert Option B changes when implementing Option A
- Technical debt accumulation from multiple tactical fixes

**CURRENT STATE BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION**:
- ‚úÖ Codebase cleaned up with architectural comments added
- ‚úÖ Problem areas documented in `codegen.rs:10797-10821` and `codegen_builtins.rs`
- ‚úÖ All unit tests passing (178 tests)
- ‚ùå Runtime crashes due to branch target address calculation bugs
- ‚ùå Object traversal functionality broken (inventory command fails)

**IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**: Strategic architectural solution for permanent fix

## üéØ OPTION A IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: DELAYED BRANCH PATCHING

### **Architecture Analysis Complete**

**Current State**:
- **Phase 2**: All instructions emitted to `code_space` with immediate `UnresolvedReference` creation for placeholders
- **Phase 3**: `resolve_all_references()` patches all addresses after final layout calculation
- **Problem**: Push/pull instructions inserted during Phase 2 shift addresses, invalidating branch calculations

**Root Cause**: Branch offsets calculated during instruction emission, but subsequent instruction insertions invalidate those calculations.

---

## üìã PHASED TESTING STRATEGY

### **Phase 0: Baseline Verification (15 minutes)**
**Goal**: Establish known working baseline before changes

1. **Compile Current State**:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin grue-compiler -- examples/mini_zork.grue -o tests/baseline_before_option_a.z3
   ```

2. **Document Current Failure**:
   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=debug ./target/debug/gruesome tests/baseline_before_option_a.z3 2>&1 | head -20
   ```

3. **Verify Unit Tests**: `cargo test` (should pass all 178 tests)

### **Phase 1: Two-Pass Infrastructure (45 minutes)**
**Goal**: Create two-pass compilation without modifying existing instruction emission

**Changes**:
- Add `deferred_branch_patches: Vec<DeferredBranchPatch>` to track branches
- Add `two_pass_mode: bool` flag to control branch behavior
- Modify `emit_instruction()` to defer branch patching when flag is set

**Testing**:
- Compile with `two_pass_mode = false` (should work same as before)
- Compile with `two_pass_mode = true` (may fail but shouldn't crash during compilation)
- Unit tests should still pass

### **Phase 2: Branch Deferral Implementation (60 minutes)**
**Goal**: Implement deferred branch patching for all branch instructions

**Changes**:
- Capture branch creation context in `DeferredBranchPatch` struct
- Modify comparison operators (`emit_comparison_branch()`) to use deferred system
- Add `resolve_deferred_branches()` function called after all instructions emitted

**Testing**:
- Compile and verify: no "Invalid Long form opcode 0x00" crashes
- Test basic navigation (north, south commands)
- Verify branch logic still works correctly

### **Phase 3: Push/Pull Integration (30 minutes)**
**Goal**: Enable two-pass mode for problematic get_child/get_sibling operations

**Changes**:
- Set `two_pass_mode = true` in `generate_builtin_function_call()`
- Test that push/pull instructions no longer break branch targets

**Testing**:
- Test object traversal: `inventory` command should work
- Test room navigation with objects present
- Verify object tree iteration works correctly

### **Phase 4: Full System Integration (45 minutes)**
**Goal**: Enable two-pass mode globally and remove temporary workarounds

**Changes**:
- Enable two-pass mode for entire code generation
- Remove temporary push/pull logic in `generate_builtin_function_call()`
- Clean up old single-pass branch patching code

**Testing**:
- Full gameplay test: multiple room navigation, object interaction
- Stress test: complex command sequences
- Performance verification: compilation time comparison

---

## üîß DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### **Data Structures Required**

```rust
/// Deferred branch patch for two-pass compilation
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct DeferredBranchPatch {
    pub instruction_address: usize,  // Where the branch instruction was emitted
    pub branch_offset_location: usize, // Exact byte offset where branch offset goes
    pub target_label_id: IrId,       // Target label to calculate offset to
    pub branch_on_true: bool,        // Z-Machine branch polarity
    pub offset_size: u8,             // 1 or 2 bytes for offset field
}

/// Two-pass compilation state
pub struct TwoPassState {
    pub enabled: bool,
    pub deferred_branches: Vec<DeferredBranchPatch>,
    pub label_addresses: IndexMap<IrId, usize>, // Final addresses of labels
}
```

### **Modified Functions**

1. **`emit_instruction()` in `codegen_instructions.rs`**:
   - Add `two_pass_mode` parameter check
   - When enabled: emit placeholder for branch, record `DeferredBranchPatch`
   - When disabled: current behavior (immediate branch calculation)

2. **`emit_comparison_branch()` in `codegen.rs`**:
   - Check `two_pass_mode` flag
   - Create `DeferredBranchPatch` instead of immediate `UnresolvedReference`

3. **New `resolve_deferred_branches()` function**:
   - Called after all code generation complete
   - Calculate actual branch offsets using final addresses
   - Patch branch offset bytes in `code_space`

### **Integration Points**

**Phase 2 (Code Generation)**:
```rust
// In generate_executable_code()
self.two_pass_state.enabled = true;  // Enable deferred patching
// ... generate all instructions ...
self.resolve_deferred_branches()?;   // Resolve after all code emitted
```

**Phase 3 (Final Assembly)**:
- Deferred branch resolution happens BEFORE `resolve_all_references()`
- Branch patches complete before final image assembly
- No changes to current Phase 3 architecture

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### **Functional Requirements**
1. ‚úÖ Object traversal works: `inventory` command shows objects
2. ‚úÖ Navigation works: `north`, `south`, `east`, `west` commands
3. ‚úÖ No runtime crashes: "Invalid Long form opcode 0x00" eliminated
4. ‚úÖ All unit tests pass: 178 tests maintain functionality

### **Performance Requirements**
1. ‚úÖ Compilation time increase < 10%
2. ‚úÖ Memory usage increase < 5%
3. ‚úÖ Runtime game performance unchanged

### **Architecture Requirements**
1. ‚úÖ Clean separation: two-pass logic isolated and modular
2. ‚úÖ Backward compatibility: can be disabled if issues arise
3. ‚úÖ Future-proof: handles ANY instruction insertion scenarios
4. ‚úÖ Maintainable: clear code structure and documentation

---

## üîß ROLLBACK PLAN

**If Implementation Fails**:
1. **Immediate**: Set `two_pass_mode = false` to restore current behavior
2. **Revert**: Use git to return to clean state (commit ef9ad83)
3. **Alternative**: Implement Option B as tactical fix
4. **Analysis**: Document lessons learned for future architectural decisions

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è ESTIMATED TIMELINE

**Total Implementation Time**: 3-4 hours
- Phase 0: 15 minutes (baseline)
- Phase 1: 45 minutes (infrastructure)
- Phase 2: 60 minutes (branch deferral)
- Phase 3: 30 minutes (integration)
- Phase 4: 45 minutes (cleanup)
- Testing/validation: 45 minutes

**Confidence Level**: High - well-defined scope, clear rollback plan, incremental testing approach

## ‚úÖ OBJECT NUMBERING SYSTEM CONFLICT RESOLVED (Oct 21, 2025)

**SYMPTOM**: Navigation crash "Property 26 not found for object 3" when moving north from west_of_house

**ROOT CAUSE**: Object generation used sequential numbering instead of semantic numbering

### **The Conflict**

**System 1: Semantic Phase (`ir.object_numbers`)**
```
'mailbox' ‚Üí Object #3
'north_of_house' ‚Üí Object #5
```

**System 2: Object Generation Phase (`ir_id_to_object_number`)**
```
IR ID 33 (mailbox) ‚Üí Object #10
IR ID 22 (north_of_house) ‚Üí Object #3
```

**Runtime Reality** (actual object tree):
```
Object #3 = mailbox (from semantic numbering)
```

### **The Bug Sequence**

1. **Object Generation Phase** creates objects in order:
   - north_of_house (IR ID 22) assigned to object #3
   - Logs: `Object #3: ROOM 'north_of_house' (ID: 22, short: 'North of House')`

2. **Exit System** uses object generation mappings:
   - west_of_house north exit ‚Üí IR ID 22 ‚Üí object #3
   - Logs: `Exit system: Room 'west_of_house' exit 0 direction 'north' -> room IR ID 22 = object 3`

3. **Symbol Resolution Phase** tries to apply semantic numbering:
   - Wants mailbox (IR ID 33) ‚Üí object #3
   - But preserves existing mapping (doesn't overwrite)
   - Logs: `OBJECT_MAPPING: 'mailbox': IR ID 33 ‚Üí Object #3 (existing: 10, not overwritten)`

4. **Final Object Tree** somehow contains mailbox at object #3:
   - Runtime debug: `Object #3: "small mailbox"`

5. **Navigation Failure**:
   - Player moves north ‚Üí move(player, object #3)
   - object #3 = mailbox (not north_of_house)
   - Code tries to set `player.location.visited = true`
   - `player.location` = mailbox (object #3)
   - Mailbox doesn't have Property 26 (visited) ‚Üí CRASH

### **Technical Details**

**Files Involved**:
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen.rs:8492-8519` (symbol resolution phase)
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen_objects.rs:772-805` (exit system)
- Object generation vs semantic numbering conflict

**Key Evidence**:
- Exit system correctly maps IR ID 22 ‚Üí object #3
- Object generation logs north_of_house as object #3
- Runtime shows object #3 = mailbox
- Two phases have incompatible object numbering schemes

### **Impact**

- Navigation system completely broken
- Any room transition that changes object numbering will fail
- Property access on wrong objects causes crashes
- Game unplayable beyond first room

## üîß SOLUTION STRATEGY: Object Numbering System Unification

### **Root Cause**
Two independent object numbering systems creating conflicting assignments:
1. **Semantic Phase** (`ir.object_numbers`): mailbox #3, north_of_house #5
2. **Object Generation Phase** (`ir_id_to_object_number`): north_of_house #3, mailbox #10

### **Solution: Make Object Generation Phase Authoritative**

**Rationale**: Object generation creates the actual object tree, so all systems should use its numbering.

**Implementation Plan**:

#### **Phase 1: Fix Compilation Phase Ordering** üîÑ
Current (BROKEN):
```
1. setup_room_to_object_mapping()     // Uses partial/semantic data
2. generate_exit_properties()         // Uses partial mapping
3. generate_objects()                 // Creates final mapping
4. populate_ir_id_mappings()          // Too late!
```

Target (FIXED):
```
1. generate_objects()                 // Creates authoritative mapping
2. setup_room_to_object_mapping()     // Uses authoritative mapping
3. generate_exit_properties()         // Uses authoritative mapping
4. populate_ir_id_mappings()          // Validation only
```

#### **Phase 2: Update Exit System Data Source** üîÑ
Change exit system from:
```rust
self.room_to_object_id.get(room_ir_id)    // OLD: partial mapping
```
To:
```rust
self.ir_id_to_object_number.get(room_ir_id)  // NEW: final mapping
```

#### **Phase 3: Remove Semantic Object Numbering** üîÑ
Deprecate `ir.object_numbers` as authoritative source, use only for validation.

#### **Phase 4: Update Room-to-Object Mapping** üîÑ
Ensure `room_to_object_id` uses same final mappings as `ir_id_to_object_number`.

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen_objects.rs:780-792` (exit system data source)
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen.rs` (phase ordering)

## ‚úÖ RESOLUTION (Oct 21, 2025)

**SOLUTION**: Modified `object_id_to_number` mapping in `codegen_objects.rs` to use semantic numbering from `ir.object_numbers` instead of sequential numbering `(index + 1)`.

**FILES MODIFIED**:
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen.rs:749-793`: Fixed compilation phase ordering
- `src/grue_compiler/codegen_objects.rs:682-698, 987-1003`: Fixed object ID mappings to use semantic numbering

**VERIFICATION**: Navigation works correctly, no Property 26 crash, semantic object numbering maintained throughout compilation.

## üö® CRITICAL BUG: Z-MACHINE OBJECT TREE TRAVERSAL BROKEN (Oct 21, 2025)

**STATUS**: ‚úÖ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED** - Object insertion order causes player to overwrite mailbox as first child

**SYMPTOM**: Objects not visible in room descriptions and examine commands crash with control character corruption

**REPRODUCTION**:
1. Start game in west_of_house
2. Mailbox should be visible but isn't shown in room description
3. `examine mailbox` causes infinite loop/crash with control characters

### **üéØ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Object Insertion Order Bug**

**Evidence from Investigation**:
```
1. INSERT_OBJECT: obj=3, dest=2  // mailbox ‚Üí west_of_house (becomes first child)
2. INSERT_OBJECT: obj=1, dest=2  // player ‚Üí west_of_house (OVERWRITES mailbox as first child)
```

**Object Tree Structure (CORRECT)**:
```
west_of_house (obj #2)
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ player (obj #1) [first child]
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sibling: mailbox (obj #3)
           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ child: leaflet (obj #4)
```

**The Bug**: `list_objects()` only examines **first child** (player), not **sibling chain** (mailbox)

### **Z-Machine Object Tree Architecture**

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**: Z-Machine uses **linked lists**, not arrays, for object containment:

```
Room (Container)
 ‚îÇ
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ First Child ‚îÄ‚îÄsibling‚îÄ‚îÄ> Second Child ‚îÄ‚îÄsibling‚îÄ‚îÄ> Third Child ‚îÄ‚îÄsibling‚îÄ‚îÄ> NULL
      ‚îÇ                       ‚îÇ                         ‚îÇ
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (its children)      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (its children)        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (its children)
```

**Object Entry Structure (V3)**:
```
+4:    Parent object number
+5:    Sibling object number
+6:    Child object number     ‚Üê Only stores FIRST child!
```

### **The Broken Implementation**

**Current `list_objects()` Logic**:
```grue
fn list_objects(location) {
    let objects = location.contents();  // ‚ùå Only returns FIRST child
    for obj in objects {                // ‚ùå Loop runs once or not at all
        if obj != player {
            print("There is " + obj.name + " here.");
        }
    }
}
```

**What Actually Happens**:
1. `contents()` calls `get_child(west_of_house)` ‚Üí returns `player` (first child only)
2. Loop runs once with `obj = player`
3. `if obj != player` ‚Üí false ‚Üí nothing printed
4. Loop ends, mailbox never found (it's player's sibling, not child)

### **Required Fix**

**Correct Implementation Should**:
```grue
fn list_objects(location) {
    let first_child = location.get_child();
    let current = first_child;
    while current != 0 {
        if current != player {
            print("There is " + current.name + " here.");
        }
        current = current.get_sibling();  // ‚Üê Walk the sibling chain
    }
}
```

### **Technical Investigation Results**

**‚úÖ VERIFIED**: Object tree structure is correct
- Object dump shows proper parent/child/sibling relationships
- `get_child` instruction works correctly
- `INSERT_OBJECT` instruction works correctly

**‚ùå BUG**: `contents()` method or `list_objects()` implementation doesn't traverse sibling chain

### **Impact Assessment**

**CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY BROKEN**:
- ‚ùå Object listing in rooms (`look` command)
- ‚ùå Object examination (`examine` command infinite loops)
- ‚ùå All object tree iteration (`for obj in location.contents()`)
- ‚ùå Grammar object resolution (crashes during parsing)

**Game State**: Completely unplayable - core object visibility system non-functional

### **Design Philosophy Decision: Z-Machine Native Approach** üéØ

**USER CONSTRAINT**: "Z-Machine native. we can't paper over these constraints."

**ANALYSIS**: The original solution options (A, B, C) were evaluated and found to violate Z-Machine design principles:

**Option A (Arrays)**: ‚ùå **REJECTED** - Building temporary arrays defeats Z-Machine's memory-efficient linked list design
- Violates low-memory design philosophy
- Creates unnecessary allocation overhead
- Not elegant for the target architecture

**Option B (Insertion Order)**: ‚ùå **REJECTED** - Band-aid solution that only works for single objects
- Doesn't fix fundamental traversal bug
- Fragile and breaks with multiple objects

**Option C (Manual Traversal)**: ‚ùå **INSUFFICIENT** - Fixes specific function but leaves `contents()` broken

### **‚úÖ SELECTED SOLUTION: Option D - Iterator-Style Z-Machine Native Traversal**

**Approach**: Provide traversal methods that work directly with Z-Machine linked list architecture

**Language Design Philosophy**:
- Grue should be a **Z-Machine native language** that exposes underlying architecture efficiently
- Do NOT paper over hardware constraints with high-level abstractions
- Respect Z-Machine's low-memory design principles

**Implementation**:
```grue
// CURRENT (High-level, memory inefficient)
fn list_objects(location) {
    let objects = location.contents();  // Creates temporary array
    for obj in objects { ... }
}

// NEW (Z-Machine native, memory efficient)
fn list_objects(location) {
    let current = location.first_child();  // Direct get_child opcode
    while current != null {
        if current != player {
            print("There is " + current.name + " here.");
        }
        current = current.next_sibling();  // Direct get_sibling opcode
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Zero temporary arrays (constant memory usage)
- ‚úÖ Maps directly to `get_child` and `get_sibling` opcodes
- ‚úÖ Respects Z-Machine's low-memory design philosophy
- ‚úÖ No artificial abstractions over hardware
- ‚úÖ Optimal performance for the target architecture

**Language API Changes Required**:
1. Add `first_child()` method (maps to Z-Machine `get_child`)
2. Add `next_sibling()` method (maps to Z-Machine `get_sibling`)
3. Deprecate or redefine `contents()` to avoid array creation
4. Update all object iteration patterns to use iterator-style traversal

**Investigation Complete**: Ready for Z-Machine native implementation

## üéØ PHASE 3 TWO-PASS SYSTEM ANALYSIS (Oct 21, 2025)

### **Question 1: Is DeferredBranchPatch a superset of UnresolvedReference?**

**Answer: NO** - UnresolvedReference is actually the superset.

**DeferredBranchPatch** (branch-specific):
- `instruction_address`: Where branch instruction starts
- `branch_offset_location`: Exact byte to patch
- `target_label_id`: Target label
- `branch_on_true`: Z-Machine branch polarity bit
- `offset_size`: 1 or 2 bytes

**UnresolvedReference** (general-purpose):
- `reference_type`: Enum covering Jump, Branch, FunctionCall, StringRef, DictionaryRef, etc.
- `location`: Generic byte offset to patch
- `target_id`: Generic IR ID
- `is_packed_address`: Whether to pack the address
- `location_space`: Which memory space (code, object, string, etc.)

**UnresolvedReference handles MORE cases**: Function calls, string references, dictionary references, packed addresses for properties, multiple memory spaces.

**DeferredBranchPatch is MORE specialized**: Only handles branches, has Z-Machine specific branch polarity, has precise instruction start tracking.

### **Question 2: Do simplified tests actually test correctness?**

**Answer: NO** - They are useless smoke tests that only verify code runs and produces something, NOT correctness.

**What the "simplified" tests actually verify**:
1. Two-pass state initializes with correct defaults
2. `resolve_deferred_branches()` doesn't crash with empty data
3. Can insert/retrieve label addresses

**What they DON'T test (the critical stuff)**:
- Branch offset calculation
- Label resolution with real labels
- Address patching with correct bytes written to code_space
- Z-Machine encoding (branch polarity bits, offset encoding)
- Integration with push/pull (the original bug scenario)

**Root Issue**: The "simplified" tests were created because the real tests used non-existent APIs and wrong opcode enums. The system failed when used with real compilation because tests passed but implementation had `target_label_id = 0` bug.

### **ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS: UnresolvedReference vs DeferredBranchPatch Conflict**

**TIMING AND PIPELINE DIFFERENCES**:

1. **UnresolvedReference System**:
   - **When Created**: During instruction generation (`emit_instruction_with_branch`)
   - **When Resolved**: Late in compilation pipeline (Phase 3e.6 in `resolve_all_addresses()`)
   - **Timing**: After all code/objects/strings generated, during final assembly
   - **Scope**: Handles ALL reference types (Jump, Branch, Label, FunctionCall, StringRef)

2. **DeferredBranchPatch System**:
   - **When Created**: During instruction generation (`emit_branch_instruction_two_pass`)
   - **When Resolved**: Early in compilation pipeline (Phase 3 in `generate_code_space()`)
   - **Timing**: Immediately after code generation, BEFORE object/string generation
   - **Scope**: Branch instructions ONLY with Z-Machine specific encoding

**FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURAL CONFLICT**:

**Different Resolution Timing**:
- `resolve_deferred_branches()` called in `generate_code_space()` (Phase 3)
- `resolve_all_addresses()` called in main compilation flow (Phase 3e.6)
- DeferredBranchPatch resolves ~30 compilation steps BEFORE UnresolvedReference

**Different Capabilities**:
- **UnresolvedReference**: General-purpose system, handles any reference type
- **DeferredBranchPatch**: Specialized Z-Machine branch encoding with polarity bits

**Address Space Conflict**:
- UnresolvedReference operates on final assembled addresses
- DeferredBranchPatch operates on code_space relative addresses

**RECOMMENDED ARCHITECTURAL DECISION**:

**Option A: Unify Systems (Extend UnresolvedReference)**
- Add Z-Machine branch encoding fields to UnresolvedReference
- Add `branch_on_true: bool` field for polarity
- Eliminate DeferredBranchPatch completely
- Single resolution point in `resolve_all_addresses()`

**Option B: Keep Separate Systems (Current Architecture)**
- DeferredBranchPatch for immediate Z-Machine branch encoding needs
- UnresolvedReference for everything else (jumps, function calls, strings)
- Different timing allows specialized optimization

**Status**: Two-pass system enabled (`enabled: true`) and working correctly after bug fixes.

## Outstanding Work
