## Test Coverage Analysis

### ✅ Comprehensive Test Suites
- **Call Tests** (7 tests): Subroutine calling, argument passing, return values
- **Branch Tests** (18 tests): All branching instructions, control flow, object operations  
- **Integration Tests** (2 tests): Real game file loading and execution

### 🟡 Testing Gaps
- **Arithmetic Operations**: No tests for ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, MOD
- **Memory Operations**: Missing STOREW, STOREB tests
- **Text Processing**: No PRINT, string handling tests
- **I/O Operations**: Missing input/output stream tests
- **Property System**: No object property manipulation tests
- **Advanced Features**: Missing RANDOM, TOKENISE, etc. tests

## Next Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Instruction Completion (Target: 60% overall)
1. **Variable Operations** (High Priority)
   - [ ] `inc` and `dec` for 1OP
   - [ ] `load` for variable access
   - [ ] `push` and `pull` for stack operations

2. **Object System** (High Priority)  
   - [ ] `set_attr` and `clear_attr`
   - [ ] `get_parent` 
   - [ ] `insert_obj` and `remove_obj`
   - [ ] Object property system (`get_prop`, `put_prop`, etc.)

3. **Memory Operations** (Medium Priority)
   - [ ] `storew` and `storeb`
   - [ ] Memory bounds checking improvements

### Phase 2: Text and I/O (Target: 75% overall)
1. **Text Processing** (High Priority)
   - [ ] `print` with Z-string decoding
   - [ ] `print_char` and `print_num`
   - [ ] `print_addr` and `print_paddr`
   - [ ] `print_obj` with object names

2. **Input Operations** (Medium Priority)
   - [ ] `sread` for user input
   - [ ] `read_char` for character input
   - [ ] Input stream management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Target: 90% overall)
1. **Game Logic Support**
   - [ ] `random` number generation
   - [ ] `scan_table` for searching
   - [ ] `tokenise` for parser support

2. **Display and Interface**
   - [ ] Window and cursor operations
   - [ ] Text styling and colors
   - [ ] Sound effects (if applicable)

## Architecture Strengths
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns (instruction parsing, execution, object system)
- ✅ Robust error handling with Result types
- ✅ Comprehensive branching logic implementation
- ✅ Well-structured object table access
- ✅ Good test infrastructure with mock objects
- ✅ Memory safety through Rust's type system

## Known Issues and Technical Debt
- Some tests use `unsafe` transmute for mock objects
- Limited to Z-machine Version 3 (Zork era)
- String/text processing not yet implemented
- No save/restore game state functionality
- Performance optimization not yet addressed

## Getting Started
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test suites
cargo test call_tests
cargo test branch_tests

# Run with test output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Contributing
Focus areas for contribution:
1. Implementing stub instructions (51 remaining)
2. Adding comprehensive tests for existing functionality
3. Text processing and Z-string decoding
4. Object property system implementation
5. Input/output stream handling
