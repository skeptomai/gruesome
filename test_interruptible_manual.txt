Testing Instructions for Interruptible Input
============================================

1. Run the game with debug logging:
   RUST_LOG=debug ./target/debug/gruesome resources/test/zork1/DATA/ZORK1.DAT

2. Look for these key messages in the debug output:
   - "read_line_with_timer called: time=0 tenths (0s), routine=0x0000"
   - "Terminal input detected - using interruptible path (no interrupts yet)"
   - "Entering interruptible input mode (currently blocking)"
   - "✓ Raw mode supported - real interrupts possible" (or the ✗ version)

3. Type a few commands and verify each one goes through the timer-based path:
   - "look"
   - "inventory"
   - "quit"
   - "y"

4. Expected behavior:
   - Game should work exactly as before (blocking input)
   - All input should go through read_line_with_timer()
   - Debug logs should confirm the interruptible path is being used
   - No actual interruptions should occur (time=0, routine=0x0000)

This confirms the infrastructure is in place for future timer implementation.
