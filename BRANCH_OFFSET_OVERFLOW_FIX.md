# HISTORICAL: Previous Patch Collision Analysis (October 24, 2025)

*This file contains historical analysis from patch collision bug investigation. Preserved for reference.*

## PATCH COLLISION BUG - COMPLETELY SOLVED! ✅

### ✅ VICTORY: October 24, 2025 - COLLISION BUG 100% ELIMINATED

**BREAKTHROUGH**: Patch collision bug completely solved through simple architectural cleanup. The issue was **UnresolvedReference entries incorrectly created for branch instructions**.

### Final Root Cause
Two functions were creating **duplicate patch entries** for the same branch offsets:
- `emit_jz_branch()`: Created both DeferredBranchPatch (✅ correct) + UnresolvedReference (❌ wrong)
- `generate_comparison_branch()`: Created both DeferredBranchPatch (✅ correct) + UnresolvedReference (❌ wrong)

**The collision logs proved this**:
```
Patched 2-byte branch: location=0x0622, value=0xc04b  ← DeferredBranchPatch (correct)
Patch 2-byte: location=0x0622 old_value=0xffff -> new_value=0x0fde  ← UnresolvedReference (overwrites!)
```

### The Fix (15 lines removed)
```rust
// REMOVED: Incorrect UnresolvedReference creation from branch instructions
// self.reference_context.unresolved_refs.push(UnresolvedReference { ... });

// ARCHITECTURAL FIX: Branch instructions should ONLY use DeferredBranchPatch system.
// The emit_instruction() call above already handles DeferredBranchPatch creation.
// UnresolvedReference should only handle operand fields, never branch offsets.
```

### Results - Complete Success
- ✅ **0 memory collisions detected** (collision detector confirms clean separation)
- ✅ **No more 0x2aa7 crashes** from corrupted branch offsets
- ✅ **Clean architecture**: DeferredBranchPatch (branch offsets only) vs UnresolvedReference (operands only)
- ✅ **Game progresses** to banner display and room description
- ✅ **144 DeferredBranchPatch + 311 UnresolvedReference entries** with zero conflicts

### Architectural Cleanup Applied
- **DeferredBranchPatch**: Branch offset fields exclusively
- **UnresolvedReference**: Operand fields exclusively
- **No memory overlap**: Perfect separation of concerns maintained
- **All warnings cleaned**: Unused variables removed, log levels corrected

## INSTRUCTION CORRUPTION BUG - COMPLETELY FIXED! ✅ (October 24, 2025)

**BREAKTHROUGH**: Architectural fix eliminated instruction corruption through proper branch placeholder emission.

### Final Root Cause
**Two-phase compilation issue**: The deferred branch patching system was emitting incorrect number of placeholder bytes initially, then attempting to "fix" them afterward:

1. **Wrong Initial Emission**: `emit_long_form_with_layout` always emitted 2-byte placeholders (`0xFFFF`) regardless of actual branch size
2. **Failed After-the-Fact Patching**: Deferred branch resolution tried to patch 1-byte branches into 2-byte placeholder space
3. **Instruction Corruption**: Extra `0xFF` bytes shifted instruction boundaries, causing crashes

### The Architectural Fix
**Modified `emit_long_form_with_layout` to emit correct placeholder size initially**:
```rust
// OLD: Always emit 2-byte placeholder
self.emit_word(placeholder_value)?;

// NEW: Emit correct size based on branch_offset_size parameter
match branch_offset_size {
    Some(1) => self.emit_byte(0xFF)?,     // 1-byte placeholder
    Some(2) => self.emit_word(placeholder_value)?, // 2-byte placeholder
}
```

### Results - Complete Success
- ✅ **Compilation successful**: No errors, clean build
- ✅ **Instruction corruption eliminated**: No more `ff e2` patterns causing crashes
- ✅ **Game executes**: Test case starts and runs without fatal instruction corruption
- ✅ **Clean bytecode**: Proper branch encoding at runtime addresses
- ✅ **Architectural cleanliness**: Emit correct bytes initially instead of patching afterward

**Status**: Historical analysis complete. Patch collision and instruction corruption bugs resolved.
