# Stack Discipline Fix Results

## Fix Applied

**Removed errant `use_push_pull_for_result` call from `get_object_contents` builtin**

**File:** `src/grue_compiler/codegen_builtins.rs`
**Change:**
```rust
// BEFORE (WRONG):
self.use_push_pull_for_result(store_var, "get_object_contents builtin")?;

// AFTER (CORRECT):
self.ir_id_to_stack_var.insert(store_var, 0);
```

## Results

### Compilation Stack Operations (Fixed)

**BEFORE (with errant pushes):**
```
STACK_PUSH: IR ID 457 at PC 0x14b9 in 'get_object_contents builtin'
STACK_PUSH: IR ID 450 at PC 0x14c7 in 'get_object_contents builtin'
STACK_PUSH: IR ID 477 at PC 0x14f3 in 'get_object_contents builtin'
```

**AFTER (no errant pushes):**
- No "get_object_contents builtin" push operations in compilation logs
- Only balanced push/pull pairs for legitimate expression evaluation
- Stack discipline properly maintained

### Runtime Behavior

**Both versions (old and new) behave identically:**

| Command | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `open mailbox` (direct) | Stack underflow ❌ |
| `look` then `open mailbox` | "You can't open that." ✅ |

### Analysis

1. **Fix is CORRECT**: Eliminated errant stack pushes from for-loop object iteration
2. **Stack underflow persists**: This appears to be a separate, deeper issue in the compiler
3. **Behavior preserved**: The fix doesn't break existing functionality

## Stack Discipline Status

✅ **Fixed:** Errant pushes from `get_object_contents` in for-loops
❌ **Remaining:** Direct "open mailbox" command still has stack underflow
✅ **Verified:** "look" command no longer leaves unbalanced stack values

## Next Investigation Required

The remaining stack underflow in "open mailbox" suggests:
1. Some initialization code expects stack values that aren't being provided
2. Property access operations in `handle_open` may have their own stack issues
3. The Z-Machine stack discipline violation may be more systemic

**This fix resolves the specific for-loop stack imbalance issue identified in the original analysis.**
