⏺ I'll analyze the WORD-PRINT routine and our dec_chk implementation to understand why "leaves" is printing as
  "leave".

⏺ Search(pattern: "dec_chk", path: "src/interpreter.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 19 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I found the issue! The dec_chk implementation is using the raw operand value instead of evaluating it. Let me
  check the exact code:

⏺ Read(src/interpreter.rs)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me find where dec_chk is actually handled:

⏺ Search(pattern: "execute_2op", path: "src/interpreter.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 40 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Found it! Now let me look at the actual execute_2op method where dec_chk is handled:

⏺ Read(src/interpreter.rs)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I see! The dec_chk is at line 945-951 (before what I just read). Let me look at that:

⏺ Read(src/interpreter.rs)
  ⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I found the bug! The issue is in how dec_chk is being handled. Looking at line 945:

  let var_num = inst.operands[0] as u8;

  This is using the raw operand value, but for Variable form instructions, the first operand should be evaluated
  according to its type. In WORD-PRINT, the instruction is:

  0x5fdf: dec_chk L01, #0000 [TRUE RTRUE]

  This is a Variable form instruction where:
  - First operand is L01 (local variable 1)
  - Second operand is #0000 (small constant 0)

  But our code is treating inst.operands[0] as the variable number directly, when it should be treating it as the
  value in L01.

  Let me check how the instruction is being decoded:

⏺ Bash(cargo run --bin analyze_word_print 2>&1 | head -30)

     === WORD-PRINT routine at 0x5fda ===
     … +25 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Wait, the disassembly shows dec_chk #0001, #0000 which means it's treating L01 as small constant 1, not as local
  variable 1. This suggests the issue might be in the instruction decoder.

  Let me create a test to trace the exact execution:

⏺ Let me look at the actual structure of the code to understand how to trace this properly:

⏺ Search(pattern: "execute_2op_variable.*dec_chk")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

⏺ Let me trace where the issue is. The problem is that dec_chk is being handled incorrectly. Let me look at where
  execute_2op_variable calls execute_2op:

⏺ Read(src/interpreter.rs)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I see the issue! Look at line 945:
  let var_num = inst.operands[0] as u8;

  This is treating the raw operand as the variable number, but this is wrong for Variable form instructions. For
  Variable form instructions, inst.operands[0] contains the actual operand value, not the variable number. The
  operand types are stored separately.

  Let me check how execute_2op_variable works:

⏺ Read(src/interpreter.rs)
  ⎿  Read 0 lines 

⏺ Let me search for execute_2op_variable:

⏺ Search(pattern: "fn execute_2op_variable", path: "src/interpreter.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I need to look at how the instruction decoder sets up operands for Variable form instructions. The issue is that
  for Variable form dec_chk, the first operand should be treated as a variable reference, not as a value.

  Let me check the Instruction struct:

⏺ Search(pattern: "struct Instruction", path: "src/instruction.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 21 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Good! The Instruction struct has operand_types which should tell us the type of each operand. Let me look at the
  actual bug fix. The issue is that for dec_chk and inc_chk, when they're Variable form instructions, we need to
  handle the first operand differently.

  Let me see what the operand types are:

⏺ Search(pattern: "enum OperandType", path: "src/instruction.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! So when dec_chk is in Variable form and the first operand type is Variable, we should use the operand
  value as the variable number. Let me fix the dec_chk and inc_chk implementation:

⏺ Excellent! I can see the problem now. The dec_chk instruction is being decoded as Long form with operand types
  [SmallConstant, SmallConstant]. This means operand 1 is being treated as the small constant 1, not as local
  variable 1.

  Looking at the output:
  - It starts with value=6 (for "leaves" which has 6 characters)
  - It prints "l", "e", "a", "v", "e" (5 characters)
  - Then when value=0, new_value wraps to 65535 and the branch is taken to return

  The instruction is correctly using variable number 1 (L01), but the decoder is treating it as a Long form
  instruction instead of Variable form. This is why our fix didn't work - the instruction form is Long, not
  Variable.

  For Long form dec_chk, the first operand is ALWAYS a variable number. Let me fix this:

⏺ Perfect! Now I understand the issue. The dec_chk instruction is in Long form with both operands as small
  constants. The bytes are:
  - 0x04: opcode (dec_chk)
  - 0x01: first operand (small constant 1, which means L01)
  - 0x00: second operand (small constant 0)
  - 0xc1: branch info (branch on true to RTRUE)

  The problem is that our disassembler shows it correctly as "dec_chk L01", but our implementation is using op1
  (which is 1, the value IN L01 after evaluation) instead of inst.operands[0] (which is 1, the variable number).

  Looking back at the debug output, op1=1 but that's because it's been evaluated already. We need to use
  inst.operands[0] which contains the raw variable number.

  Actually, wait - I already fixed that! Let me trace more carefully what's happening:

⏺ Now I see it! The call to WORD-PRINT at 0x5fda is happening from 0x6354. Looking at the logs, I can see:

  2. loadb at 0x6349: value=6 (text position for "leaves")
  3. Call to WORD-PRINT
  4. " leave" is printed (with preceding space)

  So WORD-PRINT is being called with the correct parameters (length=6, position=6), but something is wrong with how
   the parameters are being passed. Let me add more debug:

⏺ Perfect! WORD-PRINT is being called with args [6, 6] which means:
  - L01 = 6 (word length for "leaves")
  - L02 = 6 (text position)

  So the parameters are correct. The issue must be in the dec_chk logic. Let me check if the problem is the branch
  condition. When new_value wraps from 0 to 65535, the condition (new_value as i16) < 0 should be false, not true!

  Let me check the branch logic:

       966                }
       967                0x05 => {

⏺ Bash(RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin gruesome resources/test/zork1/DATA/ZORK1.DAT < test_leaves_input.txt 2>&1 |

⏺ I see the problem now! When value=1, new_value=0, and we're comparing 0 < 0, which is false, so we don't branch
  and continue the loop. This prints the 6th character 'e'.

  Then when value=0, new_value wraps to 65535. As a signed i16, that's -1, and -1 < 0 is true, so we branch to
  RTRUE and return.

  The issue is that we're printing 6 characters total when we should only print 5. The problem is the loop logic!
  Let me trace through it:

  1. L01=6, L02=6: dec L01 -> L01=5, 5 < 0? No, print char at pos 6 ('l'), inc L02 -> L02=7
  2. L01=5, L02=7: dec L01 -> L01=4, 4 < 0? No, print char at pos 7 ('e'), inc L02 -> L02=8
  3. L01=4, L02=8: dec L01 -> L01=3, 3 < 0? No, print char at pos 8 ('a'), inc L02 -> L02=9
  4. L01=3, L02=9: dec L01 -> L01=2, 2 < 0? No, print char at pos 9 ('v'), inc L02 -> L02=10
  5. L01=2, L02=10: dec L01 -> L01=1, 1 < 0? No, print char at pos 10 ('e'), inc L02 -> L02=11
  6. L01=1, L02=11: dec L01 -> L01=0, 0 < 0? No, print char at pos 11 ('s'), inc L02 -> L02=12

  Wait, that should print all 6 characters! Let me check the position more carefully:

⏺ Bash(RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin gruesome resources/test/zork1/DATA/ZORK1.DAT < test_leaves_input.txt 2>&1 |

⏺ Wait, the position is 6! That's 1-based, so the actual text starts at position 5 (0-based) in the buffer. Let me
  think about this more carefully.

  The parse buffer stores:
  - Word length: 6
  - Text position: 6 (1-based)

  So in the text buffer "move leaves", position 6 (1-based) is where "leaves" starts:
  - Position 1-4: "move"
  - Position 5: space
  - Position 6-11: "leaves"

  So WORD-PRINT is being called with L01=6 (length), L02=6 (starting position). The issue must be that we're not
  handling the position correctly. Let me trace the actual character printing:

  So it's printing " leave" (with a leading space). The issue is that WORD-PRINT is starting at the wrong position!
   The parse buffer says position 6, but that includes the space before "leaves".

  Let me check what's in the text buffer:

⏺ Wait, I made an error in my analysis. Looking at the positions:
  - Position 6 (1-based) is 'l', the first character of "leaves"
  - This is correct!

  So WORD-PRINT is being called with the correct position (6), but it's loading from offset 6 which gets the space.
   The issue must be in how WORD-PRINT uses the position.

  Looking at the WORD-PRINT routine:
  - L01 = word length (6)
  - L02 = text position (6)
  - It loads from V7d + V02

  But V02 starts at 6, and the first thing it does is load a character BEFORE decrementing the count. So it loads
  position 6, which in 0-based indexing is position 5, which is the space!

  The bug is that the parse buffer is storing 1-based positions, but WORD-PRINT is using them as if they were
  0-based! Let me fix this in the dictionary.rs where we store the position:

⏺ Read(src/dictionary.rs)
  ⎿  Read 19 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Wait no, we're storing position as 1-based which is correct per the Z-Machine spec. The issue must be that
  WORD-PRINT expects 0-based positions. But that doesn't make sense either.

  Let me think about this differently. The parse buffer stores position 6 for "leaves". In the text buffer:
  - Positions 0-3: "move"
  - Position 4: ' '
  - Positions 5-10: "leaves"

  So position 6 (1-based) maps to index 5 (0-based), which is 'l'. But WORD-PRINT is loading from base + position,
  which would be base + 6, getting index 6 which is 'e'.

  OH! I see the issue now. When WORD-PRINT loads with loadb V7d, V02, it's using V02 directly as an offset. But V02
   contains the 1-based position from the parse buffer. So when V02=6, it loads byte at offset 6, which is the 7th
  byte (0-based), which is 'e' not 'l'.

  The fix is that WORD-PRINT should subtract 1 from the position before using it as an offset! But wait, that's not
   our job to fix - the game code is what it is.

  Actually, let me reconsider. Looking at the debug output again:
  - WORD-PRINT loads from offset 6 and gets ' ' (space)
  - This means the text buffer has the space at offset 6

  So the text buffer must be:
  - offset 0-3: something (maybe length bytes?)
  - offset 4: 'm'
  - offset 5: 'o'
  - offset 6: ' ' (this is what we see)
  - offset 7: 'l'
  - etc.

  No wait, the text buffer base is 0x2641, and we're loading from 0x2647 (offset 6), getting space. Let me check
  what the text buffer format is:

⏺ Search(pattern: "text_buffer.*write_byte", path: "src", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Let me check where sread stores the input:

⏺ Search(pattern: "sread.*text_buffer", path: "src/interpreter.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 25 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me find where we actually write to the text buffer in sread:

⏺ Search(pattern: "Write to text buffer", path: "src/interpreter.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Search(pattern: "// Store the input", path: "src/interpreter.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Search(pattern: "write_byte.*text_buffer \+ 2", path: "src/interpreter.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Good! So the text buffer format is:
  - Byte 0: max length (not used here)
  - Byte 1: actual length
  - Bytes 2+: the actual text

  So if we have "move leaves", it's stored as:
  - text_buffer+2: 'm'
  - text_buffer+3: 'o'
  - text_buffer+4: 'v'
  - text_buffer+5: 'e'
  - text_buffer+6: ' '
  - text_buffer+7: 'l'
  - etc.

  The parse buffer stores position 6 (1-based) for "leaves", which means the 6th character in the text, which is at
   text_buffer+2+5 = text_buffer+7 = 'l'.

  But WORD-PRINT is loading from V7d + V02, where:
  - V7d = text buffer base address (0x2641)
  - V02 = position from parse buffer (6)

  So it loads from 0x2641 + 6 = 0x2647. Since the text starts at text_buffer+2, this is actually loading from
  position 4 of the text (0-based), which is the space!

  The issue is that the parse buffer position is relative to the start of the text (position 1 = first character),
  but WORD-PRINT is using it as an offset from the text buffer base, not from where the text actually starts
  (text_buffer+2).

  So when the parse buffer says position 6, it means:
  - The 6th character of the text
  - Which is at text_buffer + 2 + 5 = text_buffer + 7

  But WORD-PRINT uses it as:
  - text_buffer + 6

  This is off by 1! The parse buffer position needs to be adjusted by adding 1 to account for the fact that the
  text starts at offset 2 in the text buffer.

  Let me fix this:

⏺ So the text buffer format is:
  - offset 0: max length (not used here)
  - offset 1: actual length
  - offset 2+: characters

  So when we have "move leaves":
  - offset 0: max length
  - offset 1: 11 (length)
  - offset 2: 'm'
  - offset 3: 'o'
  - offset 4: 'v'
  - offset 5: 'e'
  - offset 6: ' '
  - offset 7: 'l'
  - offset 8: 'e'
  - offset 9: 'a'
  - offset 10: 'v'
  - offset 11: 'e'
  - offset 12: 's'

  And the parse buffer stores position 6 for "leaves", which means start at text buffer offset 2 + (6-1) = offset
  7, which is 'l'. But WORD-PRINT is loading from base + position = base + 6.

  AHA! The issue is that the text buffer base address (V7d) must already point to the start of the text (offset 2),
   not to the beginning of the buffer! Let me check what V7d contains:

⏺ Bash(RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin gruesome resources/test/zork1/DATA/ZORK1.DAT < test_leaves_input.txt 2>&1 |

     [2025-07-17T00:25:30Z DEBUG gruesome::interpreter]   Args: [6, 6]
     … +20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ So V7d = 0x2641. If the text buffer starts at 0x2641 and has format [max_len, actual_len, text...], then:
  - 0x2641: max_len
  - 0x2642: actual_len
  - 0x2643: first character

  But WORD-PRINT is loading from 0x2641 + 6 = 0x2647. Let me check what's at these addresses:
  - 0x2643: 'm' (offset 2 from buffer start)
  - 0x2644: 'o' (offset 3)
  - 0x2645: 'v' (offset 4)
  - 0x2646: 'e' (offset 5)
  - 0x2647: ' ' (offset 6) <- this is what WORD-PRINT loads first

  So the issue is clear: the parse buffer position is 1-based from the start of the TEXT (after the length bytes),
  but WORD-PRINT is using it as an offset from the start of the BUFFER.

  The fix is to adjust the position we store in the parse buffer. Since the text starts at offset 2 in the buffer,
  we need to add 2 to our positions:

⏺ So V7d = 0x2641. If the text buffer starts at 0x2641, then:
  - 0x2641: max length
  - 0x2642: actual length
  - 0x2643: 'm'
  - 0x2644: 'o'
  - 0x2645: 'v'
  - 0x2646: 'e'
  - 0x2647: ' ' (this matches what we see!)
  - 0x2648: 'l'
  - etc.

  So the problem is that the parse buffer is storing positions relative to the text buffer + 2 (where the actual
  text starts), but WORD-PRINT expects positions relative to the text buffer itself.

  The fix is to adjust the position when storing it in the parse buffer. We need to add 2 to account for the header
   bytes:

       142                
       143                // Advance text offset
       144                text_offset += word.len();

⏺ Now let's test again:

⏺ Bash(cargo run --bin gruesome resources/test/zork1/DATA/ZORK1.DAT < test_leaves_input.txt 2>&1 | grep -A 3 -B 3
      "You can't see")
  ⎿  >Forest                                                                                   
     This is a forest, with trees in all directions. To the east, there appears to be sunlight.

     … +4 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now it's printing "eaves" instead of "leave"! We overcorrected. Let me debug this more:

⏺ Bash(RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin gruesome resources/test/zork1/DATA/ZORK1.DAT < test_leaves_input.txt 2>&1 |
      grep "WORD-PRINT loadb" | head -10)
  ⎿ [2025-07-17T00:26:37Z DEBUG gruesome::interpreter] WORD-PRINT loadb: base=0x2641 (V7d), offset=8 (V02), addr=0x

    … +9 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



⏺ Now it's loading from offset 8 instead of 6, so we've gone too far. Let me check what the parse buffer now
  contains:

⏺ Bash(RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin gruesome resources/test/zork1/DATA/ZORK1.DAT < test_leaves_input.txt 2>&1 |
      grep "leaves.*parse entry" -A 1 -B 1)
  ⎿  [2025-07-17T00:26:47Z INFO  gruesome::interpreter]   +19: 0x00 '.'

     [2025-07-17T00:26:47Z INFO  gruesome::interpreter] *** Characters at text buffer position 8:

⏺ So now the position is 8. Let me revert that change and think more carefully:

⏺ Update(src/dictionary.rs)
  ⎿  Updated src/dictionary.rs with 1 addition and 3 removals                                                      
       136                }
       137                
       138                self.write_byte(entry_offset + 2, word.len() as u8)?;        // Word length
       139 -              // Position in text buffer. The text starts at buffer+2, so we need to add 2
       140 -              // to the text offset to get the position relative to the buffer start
       141 -              self.write_byte(entry_offset + 3, (text_offset + 2 + 1) as u8)?; // Position (1-based 
     from
           -  buffer start)
       139 +              self.write_byte(entry_offset + 3, (text_offset + 1) as u8)?; // Position (1-based)
       140                
       141                // Advance text offset
       142                text_offset += word.len();

⏺ The issue is subtle. Let me trace through what's happening:

  1. Text buffer at 0x2641 contains:
    - 0x2641: max_len
    - 0x2642: 11 (length)
    - 0x2643: 'm' (position 1 in text)
    - 0x2647: ' ' (position 5 in text)
    - 0x2648: 'l' (position 6 in text)
  2. Parse buffer stores position 6 for "leaves"
  3. WORD-PRINT gets called with L02=6
  4. WORD-PRINT loads from V7d + V02 = 0x2641 + 6 = 0x2647
  5. But 0x2647 contains the space, not 'l'!

  The problem is that V7d should point to where the text starts (0x2643), not to the buffer header (0x2641). Let me
   check where V7d is set:

⏺ Search(pattern: "V7d.*0x2641")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

⏺ V7d must be set by the game code. The issue is that our positions are correct (position 6 for "leaves"), but the
  base address in V7d is wrong. It should be text_buffer + 2, not text_buffer.

  Actually, wait. Let me think about this differently. Maybe the issue is in how we're calculating text_offset in
  parse_text. Let me check:

⏺ Read(src/dictionary.rs)
  ⎿  Read 35 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I see the issue! The text_offset is being calculated relative to the string we extracted from the text buffer,
  but it should be relative to the text buffer itself. When we split "move leaves" into words, text_offset for
  "leaves" is 5 (0-based in the string), which becomes position 6 (1-based). But this doesn't account for the
  2-byte header in the text buffer.

  Actually no, that's not right either. The position should be relative to the start of the actual text, not the
  buffer.

  Let me think about this more carefully. The Z-Machine spec says the position is "the byte offset of the word from
   the start of the text buffer". So if the text buffer structure is:
  - Byte 0: max length
  - Byte 1: actual length
  - Byte 2+: text

  Then position 1 would be byte 2 of the buffer (the first character). But our WORD-PRINT is using the position as
  an offset from the buffer start, not from byte 2.

  I think the issue is that the game expects V7d to point to text_buffer + 2 (the start of the actual text), not to
   text_buffer itself. But we can't change what the game does.

  Hold on, let me re-examine the problem. When WORD-PRINT is called:
  - It gets position 6 for "leaves"
  - It loads from V7d + 6
  - V7d = 0x2641
  - So it loads from 0x2647
  - But the text "leaves" starts at 0x2648

  So we need position 7, not position 6. But wait, that doesn't match the Z-Machine spec...

  Actually, I think I've been confusing myself. Let me look at this step by step:

  1. In the text "move leaves", 'l' is at position 6 (counting from 1)
  2. In the text buffer with header, 'l' is at offset 7 (0x2643 + 5 = 0x2648)
  3. WORD-PRINT loads from base + position = 0x2641 + 6 = 0x2647

  The issue is that position 6 means "the 6th character in the text", but WORD-PRINT is using it as "offset 6 from
  the buffer start". Since the text starts at offset 2, we need to add 1 to compensate (not 2, because position is
  already 1-based).

  Wait, that's still not right. Let me trace through more carefully:

  Text: "move leaves"
  Positions: 1234 56789...

  In text buffer:
  - offset 0: max
  - offset 1: len
  - offset 2: 'm' (position 1)
  - offset 3: 'o' (position 2)
  - offset 4: 'v' (position 3)
  - offset 5: 'e' (position 4)
  - offset 6: ' ' (position 5)
  - offset 7: 'l' (position 6)

  So position 6 maps to offset 7. But WORD-PRINT uses position directly as offset, getting offset 6 which is the
  space.

  The fix is to add 1 to the position:

⏺ Update(src/dictionary.rs)
  ⎿  Updated src/dictionary.rs with 5 additions and 1 removal                                                      
       136                }
       137                
       138                self.write_byte(entry_offset + 2, word.len() as u8)?;        // Word length
       139 -              self.write_byte(entry_offset + 3, (text_offset + 1) as u8)?; // Position (1-based)
       139 +              // The position needs to account for the 2-byte header in the text buffer
       140 +              // text_offset is 0-based position in the text string
       141 +              // We need 1-based position from buffer start, which is text_offset + 1 + 2
       142 +              // But it seems the game expects text_offset + 2 (0-based from buffer start)
       143 +              self.write_byte(entry_offset + 3, (text_offset + 2) as u8)?; // Position from buffer 
     start
       144                
       145                // Advance text offset
       146                text_offset += word.len();

⏺ Actually, let me think about this one more time. If the game expects 0-based positions from the buffer start,
  then:
  - 'l' is at buffer offset 7
  - So we should store position 7

  Let me try:

⏺ Update(src/dictionary.rs)

⏺ Ah, the debug statement is showing the old calculation. Let me fix that:

⏺ Good, now it's storing position 8. Let me check WORD-PRINT:

⏺ Bash(RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin gruesome resources/test/zork1/DATA/ZORK1.DAT < test_leaves_input.txt 2>&1 |
      grep "WORD-PRINT called with" -A 5 | head -10)

     … +4 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now WORD-PRINT is getting position 8, and loads from 0x2641 + 8 = 0x2649, which contains 'e'. That's still wrong
  - we want 'l'.

  OK, I need to be very precise here. Let me map out the exact bytes:

  Text buffer at 0x2641:
  - 0x2641: max_len
  - 0x2642: 11 (actual length)
  - 0x2643: 'm' (text[0])
  - 0x2644: 'o' (text[1])
  - 0x2645: 'v' (text[2])
  - 0x2646: 'e' (text[3])
  - 0x2647: ' ' (text[4])
  - 0x2648: 'l' (text[5]) <-- This is what we want!
  - 0x2649: 'e' (text[6])

  So we want to load from 0x2648. WORD-PRINT loads from base + position = 0x2641 + position. So we need position =
  7.

  Let me fix this:

⏺ Excellent! It's now printing "leaves" correctly! The issue was that the parse buffer stores positions as 1-based
  offsets from the start of the text string, but WORD-PRINT expects them as 0-based offsets from the start of the
  text buffer (which includes the 2-byte header).

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Fix text printing bug with 'leaves' showing as ' leave'
     ☐ Verify lantern timer decrements properly
     ☐ Add full async timer support if needed

⏺ Summary of the fix:

  The "leaves" printing bug was caused by an off-by-one error in how parse buffer positions were calculated. The
  parse buffer stores the position where each word starts in the text buffer, but:

  1. The text buffer has a 2-byte header (max_len, actual_len) before the actual text
  2. Parse positions were being calculated relative to the text string (0-based)
  3. WORD-PRINT expected positions as offsets from the buffer start (including header)

  The fix was to add 2 to the text offset when storing positions in the parse buffer, accounting for the 2-byte
  header. This ensures WORD-PRINT loads from the correct location when printing parsed words.

> side note: add WORD-PRINT and its address to the routines naming code and the ROUTINES_ADDRESSES.md. Are there 
  any other routines we've discovered as part of this process which we have not yet memorialized?

⏺ I'll add WORD-PRINT to the routine names and check for any other routines we've discovered.

⏺ Read(src/debug_symbols.rs)
  ⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Good, WORD-PRINT is already in debug_symbols.rs. Now let me check ROUTINES_ADDRESSES.md:

⏺ Read(ROUTINES_ADDRESSES.md)
  ⎿  Error: File does not exist.

⏺ Let me check if there's a similar file:

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/*ROUTINE*.md")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(ROUTINE_ADDRESSES.md)
  ⎿  Read 150 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I need to add WORD-PRINT to this file. Let me also check what other routines we discovered during our debugging:

⏺ Search(pattern: "Call to.*0x[0-9a-f]+.*unpacked.*\(", path: "src/bin", output_mode: "content", head_limit: 20)
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Let me check the debug output from our session to see what routines were mentioned:

  From our debugging session, I saw these routine addresses:
  - 0x5fda - WORD-PRINT (prints a word from the parse buffer)
  - 0x60a0 - (in WORD-PRINT) - seems to be part of WORD-PRINT, not a separate routine
  - 0x62ee - (in WORD-PRINT) - also part of WORD-PRINT
  - 0x5baa - (in INPUT-LOOP) - part of INPUT-LOOP
  - Various others that were parts of already-known routines

  Let me also check CLAUDE.md to see if we documented any routines there:

⏺ Search(pattern: "WORD-PRINT", path: "CLAUDE.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 6 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Good, WORD-PRINT is documented in CLAUDE.md. Let me update ROUTINE_ADDRESSES.md to add WORD-PRINT:

⏺ Update(ROUTINE_ADDRESSES.md)
  ⎿  Updated ROUTINE_ADDRESSES.md with 8 additions                                           
       17    | 0x5c40 | (Unknown-5c40) | Previously thought to be PARSER |
       18    | 0x6f76 | V-WALK | Walk/movement verb handler |
       19    | 0x7086 | LIT? | Check if location is lit |
       20 +  | 0x5fda | WORD-PRINT | Prints a word from parse buffer character by character |
       21    | 0x7e04 | DESCRIBE-ROOM | Room description routine |
       22    | 0x8c9a | DESCRIBE-OBJECTS | Describe objects in location |

       136    - Parses user input and sets up global variables
       137    - Returns result in G7f
       138    
       139 +  ### 0x5fda - WORD-PRINT
       140 +  Prints a word from the text buffer character by character.
       141 +  - Takes L01 = word length, L02 = text buffer position
       142 +  - Called by BUFFER-PRINT for error messages like "You can't see any X here!"
       143 +  - Uses V7d as text buffer base address
       144 +  - Loops using dec_chk to print exactly L01 characters
       145 +  
       146    ### 0x6ee0 - V-VERSION
       147    Action routine for "version" command.
       148    - Called from MAIN at 0x4f82 during initialization

⏺ Now let me check if we discovered any other routines during our debugging. Looking back through the conversation,
   I see we also encountered:

  1. NOT-HERE-OBJECT-F - This prints "You can't see any X here!"
  2. NOT-HERE-PRINT - Calls BUFFER-PRINT
  3. BUFFER-PRINT - Prints a space then calls WORD-PRINT

  But we don't have addresses for these since they were shown as ZIL code, not disassembly. Let me check if we have
   any other routine addresses in our debug output:

⏺ Search(pattern: "Call to packed address.*unpacked: [0-9a-f]+ \(", path: "src/interpreter.rs", output_mode:
        "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Let me check our debug log format:

⏺ Search(pattern: "Call to packed address", path: "src/interpreter.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ From the debug output in our conversation, I saw these routine calls:
  - 0x3050 (unpacked: 60a0) - but this was labeled "(in WORD-PRINT)" so it's not a separate routine
  - 0x3177 (unpacked: 62ee) - also "(in WORD-PRINT)"
  - 0x2fed (unpacked: 5fda) - This is WORD-PRINT itself

  So it looks like WORD-PRINT is the only new routine we discovered with a specific address. The other routines
  (NOT-HERE-OBJECT-F, NOT-HERE-PRINT, BUFFER-PRINT) were mentioned in the ZIL code but we don't have their
  addresses.

  Let me check if there are any other unknown routines in our debug_symbols.rs that should be documented:

⏺ Search(pattern: "\(Unknown", path: "src/debug_symbols.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ These unknown routines are already listed in ROUTINE_ADDRESSES.md.

  Based on my review, WORD-PRINT is the only new routine we discovered with a concrete address during this
  debugging session. The other routines mentioned (NOT-HERE-OBJECT-F, NOT-HERE-PRINT, BUFFER-PRINT) were part of
  the ZIL code explanation but we don't have their machine code addresses.

> did we find call addresses for NOT-HERE-OBJECT-F, or NOT-HERE-PRINT, or BUFFER-PRINT? BUFFER-PRINT calls 
  WORD-PRINT after printing a space.  Didn't we find that sequence in our code? And all of this is in PERFORM. Do 
  we have PERFORM's address?

⏺ You're right! Let me search for the sequence where a space is printed followed by a call to WORD-PRINT.

⏺ Search(pattern: "print at PC 0630c: ' '", path: "src/interpreter.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Let me check our debug output from the conversation. I remember seeing:

⏺ Search(pattern: "0x630c", path: "src/bin", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 128 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Yes! We found it. Looking at the debug output from our conversation, we saw:

  [2025-07-17T00:19:10Z DEBUG gruesome::interpreter] print at PC 0630c: ' '

  And then immediately after:
  [2025-07-17T00:19:10Z INFO  gruesome::interpreter] loadb at 0x6345: base=0x2557, offset=2, addr=0x2559, value=6
  [2025-07-17T00:19:10Z INFO  gruesome::interpreter] loadb at 0x6349: base=0x2557, offset=3, addr=0x255a, value=6
  [2025-07-17T00:19:10Z DEBUG gruesome::interpreter] Call to packed address 0x2fed (unpacked: 5fda (WORD-PRINT))

  So the sequence is:
  1. Print space at 0x630c
  2. Load parse buffer values at 0x6345 and 0x6349
  3. Call WORD-PRINT at 0x5fda

  This means BUFFER-PRINT is likely the routine that contains this sequence around 0x630c. Let me check what
  routine contains 0x630c:

⏺ Found it! The routine at 0x6301 has 2 locals and the print space is at 0x630c. Let me also check for PERFORM's
  address:

⏺ Read(src/debug_symbols.rs)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Yes, PERFORM is at 0x577c. Now let me find where NOT-HERE-OBJECT-F and NOT-HERE-PRINT are. From our debug logs, I
   saw:

  1. "You can't see any" was printed
  2. Then there was a call that eventually led to the space at 0x630c

  Let me search for where "You can't see any" is printed:

⏺ Search(pattern: "You can't see any", path: "src/bin", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 67 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Great! From the trace files, I can see:
  - "You can't see any" is printed at 0x4fde
  - Then routine at 0x5092 is called

  Let me find the routine that contains 0x4fde:

  - WORD-PRINT at 0x5fda (already added)

  Let me update the debug_symbols.rs and ROUTINE_ADDRESSES.md with these new routines:

       145 +  
       146 +  ### 0x508e - NOT-HERE-PRINT  
       147 +  Helper routine that prints object names in error messages.

       154    Action routine for "version" command.
       155    - Called from MAIN at 0x4f82 during initialization

⏺ Perfect! I've added all the routines we discovered:

  1. NOT-HERE-OBJECT-F (0x4fd9) - The main error handler that prints "You can't see any X here!"
  2. NOT-HERE-PRINT (0x508e) - Helper routine called by NOT-HERE-OBJECT-F
  3. BUFFER-PRINT (0x6301) - Prints a space then calls WORD-PRINT
  4. WORD-PRINT (0x5fda) - Prints individual words character by character

  We also confirmed that PERFORM is already in our list at 0x577c. These routines form the complete error message
  printing chain for the "You can't see any leaves here!" message.

  2. Added simplified timer support to the interpreter
  3. Documented all the new routines we discovered (NOT-HERE-OBJECT-F, NOT-HERE-PRINT, BUFFER-PRINT, and
  WORD-PRINT)
  4. Pushed all changes to the remote repository

  The game should now properly display error messages like "You can't see any leaves here!" instead of "You can't
  see any  leave here!".

  Feel free to play the game and let me know if you encounter any other issues!

> we decided on a simplified timer system for SREAD which still uses blocking input but emulates timer expiry after
   user input. I'm currently building binaries for apple silicon and x86 on mac os and both work. Should I be able 
  to build for Windows with this same code?

⏺ Yes, you should be able to build for Windows with the same code! Rust's cross-platform support is excellent, and
  looking at your code:

  1. No platform-specific dependencies: Your code uses standard Rust libraries and doesn't have any Unix-specific
  system calls
  2. File paths: You're already using forward slashes in paths like "resources/test/zork1/DATA/ZORK1.DAT", which
  Rust automatically handles correctly on Windows
  3. Terminal I/O: The print! and io::stdin().read_line() calls work across platforms

  To build for Windows from macOS, you'll need to:

  1. Install the Windows target:
  rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
  # or for MSVC toolchain:
  rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

  2. Install a cross-compilation toolchain:
    - For GNU: brew install mingw-w64
    - For MSVC: More complex, usually easier to use GNU
  3. Build:
  cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release

  The only potential issue might be terminal handling for the flush() calls after print!, but those should work
  fine on Windows terminals.

  If you want to test Windows builds without cross-compilation, you could also use GitHub Actions to build Windows
  binaries automatically when you push changes.

> ok, we've made good progress and Zork I seems to run pretty well with the current codebase. I plan to invite 
  other developers to learn and collaborate on this project. Since they will be seeing the code for the first time,
   I want them to have an overview of how it is structured, an explanation of the main important modules, structs, 
  functions, etc. Please generate a markdown document, perhaps with a diagram graph of connections between 
  important logical blocks, of the entire code project, with explanations

⏺ Perfect! I've created comprehensive documentation for new developers:

  1. ARCHITECTURE.md - A high-level overview with:
    - Mermaid diagram showing component relationships
    - Detailed explanations of each major system
    - Key algorithms and implementation details
    - Known issues and fixes
  2. CODEBASE_GUIDE.md - A practical guide with:
    - Recommended reading order for new developers
    - Module relationship diagram
    - Key code paths and functions
    - Common patterns and pitfalls
    - Testing and debugging guidance
  3. QUICK_REFERENCE.md - A handy reference with:
    - Essential commands
    - Instruction format reference
    - Common opcodes
    - Memory map
    - Debug tips

  I've also updated the README.md to prominently feature these documentation files, making it easy for new
  contributors to find their way around the codebase.

  The documentation emphasizes:
  - Clear code organization
  - How components interact
  - Common patterns to follow
  - Known issues to avoid

⏺ I notice there's a save file that got added. Let me remove that from the commit since it's probably from testing:

⏺ Bash(git reset HEAD in_house_at_trap_door.sav)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> let's keep that sav file as an example.. maybe we should move .sav files to an examples directory?

⏺ Good idea! Let's create an examples directory for save files and move the .sav file there.

  ⎿  ./out/at_dam.sav

⏺ Bash(mv ./out/at_dam.sav examples/saves/)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Now let's create a README for the examples directory to explain what these save files are:

⏺ Write(examples/saves/README.md)

> what TODOs are still open for us to implement?

⏺ Let me check the CLAUDE.md file and search for TODOs in the codebase to see what's still open.

⏺ Read(CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Read 440 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "TODO|FIXME|XXX|HACK", path: "src", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 3 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Based on my review of CLAUDE.md and searching for TODOs in the codebase, here are the main open items:

  Major TODOs Still Open

  1. Full Async Timer Support (High Priority)

  Currently we have a simplified timer implementation that only fires after input. The full implementation needs:
  - Real-time timer interrupts during input
  - Multi-threaded or async input handling
  - Timer routines that can terminate input mid-typing
  - Support for multiple concurrent timers

  Impact: Without this, lanterns/matches never expire during gameplay, making the game easier.

  2. Character Input (read_char opcode) (Medium Priority)

  - Needed for V4+ games with menus and real-time elements
  - Requires raw terminal mode (no line buffering)
  - Must handle special keys (arrows, function keys)
  - Not used by Zork I, but needed for other games

  3. Display Opcodes (Low Priority)

  Still missing:
  - set_text_style - Bold, italic, reverse video
  - buffer_mode - Control output buffering
  - erase_line - Clear current line
  - set_cursor - Position cursor (currently stubbed)
  - get_cursor - Get cursor position
  - split_window - Status line (currently stubbed)

  4. Version Support Beyond V3 (Future)

  - V4: Larger games, more opcodes
  - V5: Even larger games, new features
  - V6: Graphics support
  - V7-V8: Very large games

  5. Performance Optimizations

  - Optimize hot paths in the interpreter loop
  - Consider computed goto or similar techniques
  - Profile and optimize text decoding

  Minor TODOs in Code

  1. text.rs:225 - Add offset handling for V6-7 packed addresses
  2. Various test binaries - Some have hacky approaches noted

  What's Been Completed Recently

  ✓ Text printing bug (leaves showing as "leave")✓ Simplified timer support (fires after input)✓ Save/restore with
  Quetzal format✓ Random number generation✓ Sound effects (beeps)✓ Comprehensive documentation

  The most impactful TODO would be implementing full async timer support, as it affects core gameplay mechanics in
  Zork I. The simplified timer implementation works but doesn't provide the authentic experience where you can see
  the lantern countdown while thinking about your next move.
