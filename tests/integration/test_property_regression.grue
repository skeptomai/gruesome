// Regression test for property table and object mapping issues
// This test covers all the failure modes we've encountered:
// 1. Simple property assignment (test_room.visited = true)
// 2. Chained property assignment (player.location.visited = true) 
// 3. Multiple rooms with different object numbers
// 4. Property access after assignment
